abstract = {Applied researchers have employed chi-square tests for more than one hundred years. This paper addresses the question of how one should follow a statistically significant chi-square test result in order to determine the source of that result. Four approaches were evaluated: calculating residuals, comparing cells, ransacking, and partitioning. Data from two recent journal articles were used to illustrate these approaches. A call is made for greater consideration of foundational techniques such as the chi-square tests.},

abstract = {value used to represent the extent to which a null hypothesis is false. As an effect size, Cohen's d is typically used to represent the magnitude of differences between two (or more) groups on a given variable, with larger values representing a greater differentiation between the two groups on that variable. When comparing means in a scientific study, the reporting of an effect size such as Cohen's d is considered complementary to the reporting of results from a test of statistical significance. Whereas the test of statistical significance is used to suggest whether a null hypothesis is true (no difference exists between Populations A and B for a specific phenomenon) or false (a difference exists between [p. 181 â†“ ] Populations A and B for a specific phenomenon), the calculation of an effect size estimate is used to represent the degree of difference between the two populations in those instances for which the null hypothesis was deemed false. In cases for which the null hypothesis is false (i.e., rejected), the results of a test of statistical significance imply that reliable differences exist between two populations on the phenomenon of interest, but test outcomes do not provide any value regarding the extent of that difference. The calculation of Cohen's d and its interpretation provide a way to estimate the actual size of observed differences between two groups, namely, whether the differences are small, medium, or large.},

abstract = {Biophysically detailed models of single cells are difficult to fit to real data. Recent advances in imaging techniques allow simultaneous access to various intracellular variables, and these data can be used to significantly facilitate the modelling task. These data, however, are noisy, and current approaches to building biophysically detailed models are not designed to deal with this. We extend previous techniques to take the noisy nature of the measurements into account. Sequential Monte Carlo ("particle filtering") methods, in combination with a detailed biophysical description of a cell, are used for principled, model-based smoothing of noisy recording data. We also provide an alternative formulation of smoothing where the neural nonlinearities are estimated in a non-parametric manner. Biophysically important parameters of detailed models (such as channel densities, intercompartmental conductances, input resistances, and observation noise) are inferred automatically from noisy data via expectation-maximization. Overall, we find that model-based smoothing is a powerful, robust technique for smoothing of noisy biophysical data and for inference of biophysical parameters in the face of recording noise.},

@article{McHugh2013,
abstract = {The Chi-square statistic is a non-parametric (distribution free) tool designed to analyze group differences when the dependent variable is measured at a nominal level. Like all non-parametric statistics, the Chi-square is robust with respect to the distribution of the data. Specifically, it does not require equality of variances among the study groups or homoscedasticity in the data. It permits evaluation of both dichotomous independent variables, and of multiple group studies. Unlike many other non-parametric and some parametric statistics, the calculations needed to compute the Chi-square provide considerable information about how each of the groups performed in the study. This richness of detail allows the researcher to understand the results and thus to derive more detailed information from this statistic than from many others. The Chi-square is a significance statistic, and should be followed with a strength statistic. The Cramer's V is the most common strength test used to test the data when a significant Chi-square result has been obtained. Advantages of the Chi-square include its robustness with respect to distribution of the data, its ease of computation, the detailed information that can be derived from the test, its use in studies for which parametric assumptions cannot be met, and its flexibility in handling data from both two group and multiple group studies. Limitations include its sample size requirements, difficulty of interpretation when there are large numbers of categories (20 or more) in the independent or dependent variables, and tendency of the Cramer's V to produce relative low correlation measures, even for highly significant results.},
