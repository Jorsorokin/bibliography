abstract = {The perpetual activity of the cerebral cortex is largely supported by the variety of oscillations the brain generates, spanning a number of frequencies and anatomical locations, as well as behavioral correlates. First, we review findings from animal studies showing that most forms of brain rhythms are inhibition-based, producing rhythmic volleys of inhibitory inputs to principal cell populations, thereby providing alternating temporal windows of relatively reduced and enhanced excitability in neuronal networks. These inhibition-based mechanisms offer natural temporal frames to group or "chunk" neuronal activity into cell assemblies and sequences of assemblies, with more complex multi-oscillation interactions creating syntactical rules for the effective exchange of information among cortical networks. We then review recent studies in human psychiatric patients demonstrating a variety alterations in neural oscillations across all major psychiatric diseases, and suggest possible future research directions and treatment approaches based on the fundamental properties of brain rhythms.},

@article{Favero2012b,
abstract = {During behavioral quiescence, such as slow-wave sleep and anesthesia, the neocortex is in a deactivated state characterized by the presence of slow oscillations. During arousal, slow oscillations are absent and the neocortex is in an activated state that greatly impacts information processing. Neuromodulators acting in neocortex are believed to mediate these state changes, but the mechanisms are poorly understood. We investigated the actions of noradrenergic and cholinergic activation on slow oscillations, cellular excitability, and synaptic inputs in thalamocortical slices of somatosensory cortex. The results show that neuromodulation abolishes slow oscillations, dampens the excitability of principal cells, and rebalances excitatory and inhibitory synaptic inputs in thalamocortical-recipient layers IV-III. Sensory cortex is much more selective about the inputs that can drive it. The source of neuromodulation is critically important in determining this selectivity. Cholinergic activation suppresses the excitatory and inhibitory conductances driven by thalamocortical and intracortical inputs. Noradrenergic activation suppresses the excitatory conductance driven by intracortical inputs but not by thalamocortical inputs and enhances the inhibitory conductance driven by thalamocortical inputs but not by intracortical inputs. Thus noradrenergic activation emphasizes thalamocortical (sensory) inputs relative to intracortical inputs, while cholinergic activation suppresses both.},

abstract = {Multiple neuromodulators regulate neuronal response properties and synaptic connections in order to adjust circuit function. Inhibitory interneurons are a diverse group of cells that are differentially modulated depending on neuronal subtype and play key roles in regulating local circuit activity. Importantly, new tools to target specific subtypes are greatly improving our understanding of interneuron circuits and their modulation. Indeed, recent work has demonstrated that during different behavioral states interneuron activity changes in a subtype specific manner in both neocortex and hippocampus. Furthermore, in neocortex, modulation of specific interneuron microcircuits results in pyramidal cell disinhibition with important consequences for synaptic plasticity and animal behavior. Thus, neuromodulators tune the output of different interneuron subtypes to provide neural circuits with great flexibility. {\textcopyright} 2014.},

abstract = {Voltage-sensitive dye imaging (VSDI) is a powerful technique for measuring neural population responses from a large cortical region simultaneously with millisecond temporal resolution and columnar spatial resolution. However, the relationship between the average VSDI signal and the average spiking activity of neural populations is largely unknown. To better understand this relationship, we compared visual responses measured from V1 of behaving monkeys using VSDI and single-unit electrophysiology. We found large and systematic differences between position and orientation tuning properties obtained with these two techniques. We then determined that a simple computational model could explain these tuning differences. This model, together with our experimental results, allowed us to estimate the quantitative relationship between the average VSDI signal and local spiking activity. We found that this relationship is similar to the previously reported nonlinear relationship between average membrane potential and spike rate in single V1 neurons, suggesting that VSDI signals are dominated by subthreshold synaptic activity. This model, together with the VSDI measured maps for spatial position (retinotopy) and orientation, also allowed us to estimate the spatial integration area over which neural responses contribute to the VSDI signal at a given location. We found that the VSDI-integration area is consistent with a Gaussian envelope with a space constant of ∼230 $\mu$m. Finally, we show how this model and estimated parameters can be used to predict the pattern of population responses at the level of spiking activity from VSDI responses.},

abstract = {We used electron microscopy to determine the relative numbers of the three synaptic terminal types, RL (round vesicle, large terminal), RS (round vesicles, small terminal), and F (flattened vesicles), found in several representative thalamic nuclei in cats chosen as representative examples of first and higher order thalamic nuclei, where the first order nuclei relay subcortical information mainly to primary sensory cortex, and the higher order nuclei largely relay information from one cortical area to another. The nuclei sampled were the first order ventral posterior nucleus (somatosensory) and the ventral portion of the medial geniculate nucleus (auditory), and the higher order posterior nucleus (somatosensory) and the medial portion of the medial geniculate nucleus (auditory). We found that the relative percentage of synapses from RL terminals varied significantly among these nuclei, these values being higher for first order nuclei (12.6{\%} for the ventral posterior nucleus and 8.2{\%} for the ventral portion of the medial geniculate nucleus) than for the higher order nuclei (5.4{\%} for the posterior nucleus, and 3.5{\%} for the medial portion of the medial geniculate nucleus). This is consistent with a similar analysis of first and higher order nuclei for the visual system (the lateral geniculate nucleus and pulvinar, respectively). Since synapses from RL terminals represent the main information to be relayed, whereas synapses from F and RS terminals are modulatory in function, we conclude that there is relatively more modulation of the thalamic relay in the cortico-thalamo-cortical higher order pathway than in first order relays. ?? 2007 IBRO.},

@article{Contreras1995b,
abstract = {A slow oscillation ({\textless} 1 Hz) has recently been described in intracellular recordings from the neocortex and thalamus (Steriade et al., 1993c-e). The aim of the present study was to determine the phase relations between cortical and thalamic neuronal activities during the slow EEG oscillation. Intracellular recordings were performed in anesthetized cats from neurons in motor and somatosensory cortical areas, the rostrolateral sector of the reticular (RE) thalamic nucleus, and thalamocortical (TC) cells from ventrolateral (VL) nucleus. The EEG was used as time reference for alignment of activities in different, simultaneously recorded neurons, including dual impalements of cortical cells as well as cortical and TC cells. The spontaneous EEG oscillation was characterized by slowly recurring (0.3-0.9 Hz) sequences of surface-positive (depth-negative) sharp deflections, often followed by oscillatory activity within the frequency range of sleep spindles (7-14 Hz) or at faster frequencies. Cortical and RE cells were similarly hyperpolarized during the depth-positive EEG waves and were depolarized during the depth-negative EEG deflections. In many instances, the cell depolarization was associated with oscillations at the spindle frequency or with tonic firing at rates related to the level of depolarization. TC neurons were hyperpolarized during the depth-positive EEG waves and displayed a series of IPSPs, at the spindle frequencies, during the depth-negative EEG waves. Depending on the membrane potential (Vm), TC cells could fire spike bursts at the onset of the EEG depth-negativity, or their firing could be delayed by subsequent IPSPs. The sequence of spontaneous EEG and cellular events described above also characterized the responses to cortical and thalamic stimulation. Simultaneous intracellular recordings of pairs of cortical cells or cortical and TC cells showed that spontaneous transitions from less synchronized to more synchronized EEG states were marked by a simultaneous hyperpolarization, coincident with an overt depth-positive EEG wave. We conclude that during low-frequency oscillatory states, characteristic of slow-wave sleep, neocortical and thalamic neurons display phase relations that are restricted to narrow time windows, and that synchronization results from a generalized inhibitory phenomenon. Moreover, EEG synchronization is reflected as active inhibition in TC neurons. That this pattern is also present in states of hypersynchronization, such as seizure activity, is shown in the following paper (Steriade and Contreras, 1994).},

@article{Kalmbach2014b,
abstract = {Release of acetylcholine (ACh) in neocortex is important for learning, memory and attention tasks. The primary source of ACh in neocortex is axons ascending from the basal forebrain. Release of ACh from these axons evokes changes in the cortical local field potential (LFP), including a decline in low-frequency spectral power that is often referred to as desynchronization of the LFP and is thought to result from the activation of muscarinic ACh receptors. Using channelrhodopsin-2, we selectively stimulated the axons of only cholinergic basal forebrain neurons in primary somatosensory cortex of the urethane-anesthetized mouse while monitoring the LFP. Cholinergic stimulation caused desynchronization and two brief increases in higher-frequency power at stimulus onset and offset. Desynchronization (1-6 Hz) was localized, extending ≤ 1 mm from the edge of stimulation, and consisted of both nicotinic and muscarinic receptor-mediated components that were inhibited by mecamylamine and atropine, respectively. Hence we have identified a nicotinic receptor-mediated component to desynchronization. The increase in higher-frequency power ({\textgreater}10 Hz) at stimulus onset was also mediated by activation of nicotinic and muscarinic receptors. However, the increase in higher-frequency power (10-20 Hz) at stimulus offset was evoked by activation of muscarinic receptors and inhibited by activation of nicotinic receptors. We conclude that the activation of nicotinic and muscarinic ACh receptors in neocortex exerts several effects that are reflected in distinct frequency bands of the cortical LFP in urethane-anesthetized mice.},

abstract = {The cellular mechanisms underlying typical absence seizures, which characterize various idiopathic generalized epilepsies, are not fully understood, but impaired gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA)-ergic inhibition remains an attractive hypothesis. In contrast, we show here that extrasynaptic GABA(A) receptor-dependent 'tonic' inhibition is increased in thalamocortical neurons from diverse genetic and pharmacological models of absence seizures. Increased tonic inhibition is due to compromised GABA uptake by the GABA transporter GAT-1 in the genetic models tested, and GAT-1 is crucial in governing seizure genesis. Extrasynaptic GABA(A) receptors are a requirement for seizures in two of the best characterized models of absence epilepsy, and the selective activation of thalamic extrasynaptic GABA(A) receptors is sufficient to elicit both electrographic and behavioral correlates of seizures in normal rats. These results identify an apparently common cellular pathology in typical absence seizures that may have epileptogenic importance and highlight potential therapeutic targets for the treatment of absence epilepsy.},

abstract = {Generalized epilepsy is characterized by recurrent seizures caused by oscillatory neuronal firing throughout thalamocortical networks. Current therapeutic approaches often intervene at the level of the thalamus or cerebral cortex to ameliorate seizures. We review here the therapeutic potential of cerebellar stimulation. The cerebellum forms a prominent ascending input to the thalamus and, whereas stimulation of the foliated cerebellar cortex exerts inconsistent results, stimulation of the centrally located cerebellar nuclei (CN) reliably stops generalized seizures in experimental models. Stimulation of this area indicates that the period of stimulation with respect to the phase of the oscillations in thalamocortical networks can optimize its effect, opening up the possibility of developing on-demand deep brain stimulation (DBS) treatments. Electrical neurostimulation is commonly applied in patients with drug-resistant epilepsy, but the optimal stimulation sites for each of the type of seizures remain to be identified and may be outside the epileptic focus.The most important issues for identifying the optimal stimulation site are its anatomical connections, its impact on the neuronal spiking patterns of downstream targets when stimulated, and its accessibility.Emerging data from optogenetic studies in mouse models of various epilepsies indicate that controlling the cerebellar output can be effectively used to stop several types of seizures.By selectively increasing or decreasing the spiking activity of CN neurons, the firing of downstream neurons in thalamocortical networks can be efficiently modulated so as to disrupt epileptic activity.},

abstract = {Thalamocortical activity exhibits two distinct states: (a) synchronized rhythmic activity in the form of delta, spindle, and other slow waves during EEG-synchronized sleep and (b) tonic activity during waking and rapid-eye-movement sleep. Spindle waves are generated largely through a cyclical interaction between thalamocortical and thalamic reticular neurons involving both the intrinsic membrane properties of these cells and their anatomical interconnections. Specific alterations in the interactions between these cells can result in the generation of paroxysmal events resembling absence seizures in children. The release of several different neurotransmitters from the brain stem, hypothalamus, basal forebrain, and cerebral cortex results in a depolarization of thalamocortical and thalamic reticular neurons and an enhanced excitability in many cortical pyramidal cells, thereby suppressing the generation of sleep rhythms and promoting a state that is conducive to sensory processing and cognition.},

abstract = {It is widely accepted that corticothalamic neurons recruit the thalamus in slow oscillation, but global slow-wave thalamocortical dynamics have never been experimentally shown. We analyzed intracellular activities of neurons either from different cortical areas or from a variety of specific and nonspecific thalamic nuclei in relation to the phase of global EEG signal in ketamine-xylazine anesthetized mice. We found that, on average, slow-wave active states started off within frontal cortical areas as well as higher-order and intralaminar thalamus (posterior and parafascicular nuclei) simultaneously. Then, the leading edge of active states propagated in the anteroposterior/lateral direction over the cortex at ∼40 mm/s. The latest structure we recorded within the slow-wave cycle was the anterior thalamus, which followed active states of the retrosplenial cortex. Active states from different cortical areas tended to terminate simultaneously. Sensory thalamic ventral posterior medial and lateral geniculate nuclei followed cortical active states with major inhibitory and weak tonic-like "modulator" EPSPs. In these nuclei, sharp-rising, large-amplitude EPSPs ("drivers") were not modulated by cortical slow waves, suggesting their origin in ascending pathways. The thalamic active states in other investigated nuclei were composed of depolarization: some revealing "driver"- and "modulator"-like EPSPs, others showing "modulator"-like EPSPs only. We conclude that sensory thalamic nuclei follow the propagating cortical waves, whereas neurons from higher-order thalamic nuclei display "hub dynamics" and thus may contribute to the generation of cortical slow waves.},

It has been implemented in a commercially available data acquisition system and its performance experimentally verified. ECoG recordings lasting 5-8 h from rats (n= 8) of the WAG/Rij strain were analyzed using the real-time SWD detection system. The results indicate that the algorithm is able to detect SWDs within 1 s with 100{\%} sensitivity and with a precision of 96.6{\%} for the number of SWDs. Similar results are achieved for 24-h ECoG recordings of two rats. The dependence of accuracy and speed of detection on program settings and attributes of ECoG are discussed. It is concluded that the wavelet based real-time detecting algorithm is well suited for automatic, real-time detection of SWDs in rodents. {\textcopyright} 2010 Elsevier B.V.},

abstract = {Spike-frequency adaptation in neocortical pyramidal neurons was examined using the whole cell patch-clamp technique and a phenomenological model of neuronal activity. Noisy current was injected to reproduce the irregular firing typically observed under in vivo conditions. The response was quantified by computing the poststimulus histogram (PSTH). To simulate the spiking activity of a pyramidal neuron, we considered an integrate-and-fire model to which an adaptation current was added. A simplified model for the mean firing rate of an adapting neuron under noisy conditions is also presented. The mean firing rate model provides a good fit to both experimental and simulation PSTHs and may therefore be used to study the response characteristics of adapting neurons to various input currents. The models enable identification of the relevant parameters of adaptation that determine the shape of the PSTH and allow the computation of the response to any change in injected current. The results suggest that spike frequency adaptation determines a preferred frequency of stimulation for which the phase delay of a neuron's activity relative to an oscillatory input is zero. Simulations show that the preferred frequency of single neurons dictates the frequency of emergent population rhythms in large networks of adapting neurons. Adaptation could therefore be one of the crucial factors in setting the frequency of population rhythms in the neocortex.},

abstract = {High-frequency synchronous activity of neurons in the cerebral cortex and thalamus is a concomitant of discrete conscious events. In the primate thalamus, a newly identified population of neurons provides a basis for this synchronization. A matrix of calbindin-immunoreactive neurons extends throughout the thalamus and projects to superficial layers of cortex over wide areas, unconstrained by boundaries between areas. In some nuclei, a core of parvalbumin-immunoreactive neurons is superimposed upon the matrix. Core neurons project in a topographically ordered fashion to middle layers of the cortex in an area-specific manner. Matrix neurons, recruited by corticothalamic connections, can disperse activity across cortical areas and thalamic nuclei. Their superficial terminations can synchronize specific and nonspecific elements of the thalamocortical network in coherent activity that underlies cognitive events.},

abstract = {At its most basic level, the function of mammalian sleep can be described as a restorative process of the brain and body; recently, however, progressive research has revealed a host of vital functions to which sleep is essential. Although many excellent reviews on sleep behavior have been published, none have incorporated contemporary studies examining the molecular mechanisms that govern the various stages of sleep. Utilizing a holistic approach, this review is focused on the basic mechanisms involved in the transition from wakefulness, initiation of sleep and the subsequent generation of slow-wave sleep and rapid eye movement (REM) sleep. Additionally, using recent molecular studies and experimental evidence that provides a direct link to sleep as a behavior, we have developed a new model, the cellular-molecular-network model, explaining the mechanisms responsible for regulating REM sleep. By analyzing the fundamental neurobiological mechanisms responsible for the generation and maintenance of sleep-wake behavior in mammals, we intend to provide a broader understanding of our present knowledge in the field of sleep research. ?? 2007 Elsevier Ltd.

We now show that within the somatosensory thalamus, cells in one nucleus, the ventrobasal complex, can influence activity in another nucleus, the medial division of the posterior complex. Stimulation of ventrobasal complex cells evoked inhibitory postsynaptic currents in cells of the medial division of the posterior complex. These currents exhibited the reversal potential and pharmacology of a GABAA receptor-mediated chloride conductance, indicating that they result from the activation of a disynaptic pathway involving the GABAergic cells of the thalamic reticular nucleus. These findings provide the first direct evidence for intrathalamic interactions between dorsal thalamic nuclei.},

abstract = {Many neurological and psychiatric diseases are associated with clinically detectable, altered brain dynamics. The aberrant brain activity, in principle, can be restored through electrical stimulation. In epilepsies, abnormal patterns emerge intermittently, and therefore, a closed-loop feedback brain control that leaves other aspects of brain functions unaffected is desirable. Here, we demonstrate that seizure-triggered, feedback transcranial electrical stimulation (TES) can dramatically reduce spike-and-wave episodes in a rodent model of generalized epilepsy. Closed-loop TES can be an effective clinical tool to reduce pathological brain patterns in drug-resistant patients.},

@article{Gray1995b,
abstract = {The majority of techniques for separating multiple single-unit spike trains from a multi-unit recording rely on the assumption that different cells exhibit action potentials having unique amplitudes and waveforms. When this assumption fails, due to the similarity of spike shape among different cells or to the presence of complex spikes with declining intra-burst amplitude, these methods lead to errors in classification. In an effort to avoid these errors, the stereotrode (McNaughton et al., 1983) and later the tetrode (O'Keefe and Reece, 1993; Wilson and McNaughton, 1993) recording techniques were developed. Because the latter technique has been applied primarily to the hippocampus, we sought to evaluate its performance in the neocortex. Multi-unit recordings, using single tetrodes, were made at 28 sites in area 17 of 3 anesthetized cats. Neurons were activated with moving bars and square wave gratings. Single units were separated by identification of clusters in 2-D projections of either peak-to-peak amplitude, spike width, spike area, or the 1st versus 2nd principal components of the waveforms recorded on each channel. Using tetrodes, we recorded a total of 154 single cells (mean = 5.4, max = 9). By cross-checking the performance of the tetrode with the stereotrode and electrode, we found that the best of the 6 possible stereotrode pairs and the best of 4 possible electrodes from each tetrode yielded 102 (mean = 3.6, max = 7) and 95 (mean = 3.4, max = 6) cells, respectively. Moreover, we found that the number of cells isolated at each site by the tetrode was greater than the stereotrode or electrode in 16/28 and 28/28 cases, respectively. Thus, both stereotrodes, and particularly electrodes, often lumped 2 or more cells in a single cluster that could be easily separated by the tetrode. We conclude that tetrode recording currently provides the best and most reliable method for the isolation of multiple single units in the neocortex using a single probe.},

abstract = {Wistar rats of a selected strain show spontaneous generalized non-convulsive seizures with bilateral synchronous spike-wave discharges on the cortical electroencephalograph (EEG). The 7 to 9 c/s spike-wave discharges occur predominantly in waking states of inactivity. The effects of cholinergic drugs on the cumulated duration of spike-wave discharges were investigated in this rat model of absence epilepsy. I.p. injections of drugs which potentiate cholinergic neurotransmission, namely the acetylcholinesterase inhibitor, physostigmine (0.1-0.5 mg/kg), the muscarinic receptor agonists, oxotremorine (0.25-1 mg/kg) and pilocarpine (0.125-2 mg/kg), and the nicotinic receptor agonist, nicotine (0.062-2 mg/kg), suppressed discharges in a dose-dependent manner and induced an arousal-like cortical EEG. The muscarinic receptor antagonist, scopolamine, increased the spike-wave discharges at doses below 0.05 mg/kg; at higher doses (0.05-1 mg/kg) it decreased discharges and induced a sleep-like EEG. The nicotinic receptor antagonist, mecamylamine (0.5-6 mg/kg), had no effect on spike-wave discharges or the EEG. These results suggest that cholinergic activity accounts for the preferential occurrence of absence seizures in states of reduced arousal.},

abstract = {Extracellular single unit and electroencephalographic (EEG) activity during generalized spike and wave discharges (SW) induced by i.m. penicillin was recorded simultaneously in the cortex, in a 'specific' thalamic nucleus (n. lateralis posterior, LP) and in some 'non-specific' thalamic nuclei (n. centralis medialis, NCM; n. centrum medianum, CM; n. centralis lateralis, CL) Computer-generated EEG averages and histograms of single unit activity were triggered by either peaks of EEG transients or action potentials. The time at which cortical neurons (66/66) were most likely to fire was during the 'spike' of the SW complex while absence of firing was the rule during the 'wave'. Most LP neurons (23/26) showed a similar pattern, 3 cells firing preferentially during the 'wave'. In NCM only 17 of 39 neurons fired during the 'spike', 8 of 39 neurons during the 'wave' while the others showed no change in their firing pattern during SWs. Twenty-six of 30 CM and 20 of 24 CL neurons fired during the 'spike' of SW; the other cells in these nuclei did not change their firing pattern during SWs. When present, rhythmic fluctuations in firing linked to SW discharge were less prominent in these 'non-specific' thalamic nuclei than in cortex and LP. Furthermore, participation of NCM, CM and CL neurons in the SW rhythm occurred only after neurons in cortex and LP had become involved in it. Thus, as is the case for cortical neurons, the main firing pattern of thalamic cells during SWs consists of an oscillation between 'excitation' during the 'spike' and 'inhibition' during the 'wave' of the SW complex. However, the coupling between cortical and thalamic neuronal firing is less intimate for cells of the 'non-specific' thalamic nuclei than for a 'specific' nucleus such as LP. Thus, at least some 'specific' thalamic nuclei are more intimately involved in the mechanism of SW discharge than the midline intralaminar nuclei.},

Single-unit recordings were made, under moderate gaseous anesthesia (33{\%} O2-66{\%} N2O + 0.5/0.6{\%} halothane), in the ventrobasal (VB) thalamic complex of rats (n = 42) with a mononeuropathy created 2-3 wk beforehand, by four loose ligatures around the common sciatic nerve. Before the recording session, three behavioral nociceptive tests to both mechanical and thermal stimuli revealed that these rats exhibited clear hyperalgesia (excessive reactions to noxious stimuli) and allodynia (nociceptive reactions to stimuli usually perceived as nonnoxious). 2. Neurons, characterized by their responses to manual mechanical stimuli, were classified into two groups: group 1 neurons exclusively driven by light tactile stimuli applied to the receptive field (RF), strictly contralateral to the recording site; and group 2 neurons, driven by sustained pinch applied to a large RF, often bilateral. 3. From the total population of neurons (n = 386), only those responding to stimuli applied to one posterior paw were studied; the proportion (35-40{\%}) of these cells was comparable in each of the two VB: n = 93/262 and 44/124 in the VB contralateral (VBc) and ipsilateral (VBi) to the damaged nerve, respectively. The proportions of each functional group of neurons (group 1 or 2) were also similar on each side. 4. For all group 1 neurons the RFs size was comparable to that observed in normal rats. In the VBi the responses of these neurons presented the classical response pattern observed for VB neurons involved in touch transmission, as did the VBc group 1 neurons with RFs in the saphenous (Sa) territory. In sharp contrast, activities of VBc group 1 neurons with RFs in the sciatic (Sc) nerve territory exhibited several abnormalities: higher background activity, fading of the response with repetitive stimulation, and afterdischarges outlasting the applied stimulus. 5. As in normal rats, 52{\%} of VB group 2 neurons exhibited bilateral symmetrical RFs. Their responses to mechanical stimuli were often greater for stimuli applied to the affected paw, and some of them could be activated by moderate pressure to this paw. Heat responses also illustrated the profound increased sensitivity of the lesioned side, and the activation threshold to thermal stimulation of these group 2 neurons was lowered by 4-6 degrees C compared to normal values. In addition, these neurons responded to immersion of the lesioned paw in a 10 degrees C water bath, a stimulus that was ineffective when applied to the opposite paw.},

abstract = {The action of ethosuximide (ETX) on Na+, K+, and Ca2+ currents and on tonic and burst-firing patterns was investigated in rat and cat thalamic neurons in vitro by using patch and sharp microelectrode recordings. In thalamocortical (TC) neurons of the rat dorsal lateral geniculate nucleus (LGN), ETX (0.75-1 mM) decreased the noninactivating Na+ current, INaP, by 60{\%} but had no effect on the transient Na+ current. In TC neurons of the rat and cat LGN, the whole-cell transient outward current was not affected by ETX (up to 1 mM), but the sustained outward current was decreased by 39{\%} at 20 mV in the presence of ETX (0.25-0.5 mM): this reduction was not observed in a low Ca2+ (0.5 mM) and high Mg2+ (8 mM) medium or in the presence of Ni2+ (1 mM) and Cd2+ (100 microM). In addition, ETX (up to 1 mM) had no effect on the low-threshold Ca2+ current, IT, of TC neurons of the rat ventrobasal (VB) thalamus and LGN and in neurons of the rat nucleus reticularis thalami nor on the high-threshold Ca2+ current in TC neurons of the rat LGN. Sharp microelectrode recordings in TC neurons of the rat and cat LGN and VB showed that ETX did not change the resting membrane potential but increased the apparent input resistance at potentials greater than -60 mV, resulting in an increase in tonic firing. In contrast, ETX decreased the number of action potentials in the burst evoked by a low-threshold Ca2+ potential. The frequency of the remaining action potentials in a burst also was decreased, whereas the latency of the first action potential was increased. Similar effects were observed on the burst firing evoked during intrinsic delta oscillations. These results indicate an action of ETX on INaP and on the Ca2+-activated K+ current, which explains the decrease in burst firing and the increase in tonic firing, and, together with the lack of action on low- and high-threshold Ca2+ currents, the results cast doubts on the hypothesis that a reduction of IT in thalamic neurons underlies the therapeutic action of this anti-absence medicine.},

abstract = {During sleep, the electroencephalogram exhibits synchronized slow waves that desynchronize when animals awaken [desynchronized states (DSs)]. During slow-wave states, the membrane potentials of cortical neurons oscillate between discrete depolarized states ("Up states") and periods of hyperpolarization ("Down states"). To determine the role of corticothalamic loops in generating Up/Down oscillations in rats, we recorded unit activities of layer 5 (L5) corticothalamic (CTh) cells in the frontal cortex, neurons in the thalamic reticular nucleus, and basal ganglia- and cerebellum-linked thalamic relay nuclei, while simultaneously monitoring the local cortical field potential to identify slow-wave/spindle oscillations and desynchronization. We found that (1) some basal ganglia-linked and reticular thalamic cells fire preferentially near the beginning of Up states; (2) thalamic cells fire more selectively at a given Up-state phase than do CTh cells; (3) CTh and thalamic cells exhibit different action potential timings within spindle cycles; and (4) neurons exhibit different firing characteristics when comparing their activity during Up states and DSs. These data demonstrate that cortico-thalamo-cortical subnetworks are temporally differentiated during slow and spindle oscillations, that the basal ganglia-linked thalamic nuclei are closely related with Up-state initiation, and that Up states and DSs are distinguished as different depolarization states of neurons within the network.},

abstract = {Evidence concerning anatomical connectivities in the human brain is sparse and based largely on limited post-mortem observations. Diffusion tensor imaging has previously been used to define large white-matter tracts in the living human brain, but this technique has had limited success in tracing pathways into gray matter. Here we identified specific connections between human thalamus and cortex using a novel probabilistic tractography algorithm with diffusion imaging data. Classification of thalamic gray matter based on cortical connectivity patterns revealed distinct subregions whose locations correspond to nuclei described previously in histological studies. The connections that we found between thalamus and cortex were similar to those reported for non-human primates and were reproducible between individuals. Our results provide the first quantitative demonstration of reliable inference of anatomical connectivity between human gray matter structures using diffusion data and the first connectivity-based segmentation of gray matter.},

abstract = {The nucleus basalis of the basal forebrain is an essential component of the neuromodulatory system controlling the behavioral state of an animal and it is thought to be important in regulating arousal and attention. However, the effect of nucleus basalis activation on sensory processing remains poorly understood. Using polytrode recording in rat visual cortex, we found that nucleus basalis stimulation caused prominent decorrelation between neurons and marked improvement in the reliability of neuronal responses to natural scenes. The decorrelation depended on local activation of cortical muscarinic acetylcholine receptors, whereas the increased reliability involved distributed neural circuits, as evidenced by nucleus basalis-induced changes in thalamic responses. Further analysis showed that the decorrelation and increased reliability improved cortical representation of natural stimuli in a complementary manner. Thus, the basal forebrain neuromodulatory circuit, which is known to be activated during aroused and attentive states, acts through both local and distributed mechanisms to improve sensory coding.},

abstract = {Sensory information is processed and transmitted through the synaptic structure of local cortical circuits, but it is unclear how modulation of this architecture influences the cortical representation of sensory stimuli. Acetylcholine (ACh) promotes attention and arousal and is thought to increase the signal-to-noise ratio of sensory input in primary sensory cortices. Using high-speed 2-photon calcium imaging in a thalamocortical somatosensory slice preparation, we recorded action potential activity of up to 900 neurons simultaneously and compared local cortical circuit activations with and without bath presence of ACh. We found that ACh reduced weak pairwise relationships and excluded neurons that were already unreliable during circuit activity. Using action potential activity from the imaged population, we generated functional wiring diagrams based on the statistical dependencies of activity between neurons. ACh pruned weak functional connections from spontaneous circuit activations and yielded a more modular and hierarchical circuit structure, which biased activity to flow in a more feedforward fashion. Neurons that were active in response to thalamic input had reduced pairwise dependencies overall, but strong correlations were conserved. This coincided with a prolonged period during which neurons showed temporally precise responses to thalamic input. Our results demonstrate that ACh reorganizes functional circuit structure in a manner that may enhance the integration and discriminability of thalamic afferent input within local neocortical circuitry.},

A central role in cortical synchronization is played by the thalamus, and in particular by the reticularis thalami nucleus, which is regarded as the pacemaker structure for the rhythmic cortical oscillations called spindle activity. Several studies have suggested that the network mechanisms which underlie spindle generation can also account for spike and wave discharges. Experimental investigations on genetic animal models of generalized epilepsy, in which seizures occur spontaneously in the absence of any inductive agent, confirmed that the thalamo-cortical system is involved in spike and wave discharge generation. According to these studies a genetically determined dysfunction in reticularis thalami neurons may alter the electroresponsiveness of the developing thalamo cortical system and cause a persistent state of abnormal excitation.},

abstract = {The thalamocortical network consists of the pathways that interconnect the thalamus and neocortex, including thalamic sensory afferents, corticothalamic and thalamocortical pathways. These pathways are essential to acquire, analyze, store and retrieve sensory information. However, sensory information processing mostly occurs during behavioral arousal, when activity in thalamus and neocortex consists of an electrographic sign of low amplitude fast activity, known as activation, which is caused by several neuromodulator systems that project to the thalamocortical network. Logically, in order to understand how the thalamocortical network processes sensory information it is essential to study its response properties during states of activation. This paper reviews the temporal and spatial response properties of synaptic pathways in the whisker thalamocortical network of rodents during activated states as compared to quiescent (non-activated) states. The evidence shows that these pathways are differentially regulated via the effects of neuromodulators as behavioral contingencies demand. Thus, during activated states, the temporal and spatial response properties of pathways in the thalamocortical network are transformed to allow the processing of sensory information. ?? 2004 Elsevier Ltd.

abstract = {Powerful mechanisms exist within the thalamus that lead to the promotion of synchronous and phasic 3 Hz neuronal activity. These mechanisms include robust burst-firing capability of thalamic neurons, recurrent excitatory and inhibitory synaptic connectivity, and long-lasting and powerful inhibitory synaptic responses arising from activity in thalamic reticular neurons and mediated by gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) receptors. The 3 Hz thalamic synchronization appears to arise from a perturbation of a physiologic, higher frequency spindle oscillation. Two currently available antiabsence medications interact with this circuitry with the net result of decreased synchronization, largely through reduction in inhibitory output from the thalamic reticular nucleus. Ethosuximide blocks T-type calcium channels and thus reduces the ability of thalamic neurons to fire bursts of spikes, thereby reducing inhibitory (and excitatory) output within the circuit. By contrast, clonazepam enhances recurrent inhibitory strength within the reticular nucleus. This results in a decreased ability of neighboring inhibitory neurons to fire synchronously and produce the powerful inhibitory synaptic responses that are required for network synchronization.},

abstract = {Biological systems are notoriously noisy. Noise, therefore, also plays an important role in many models of neural impulse generation. Noise is not only introduced for more realistic simulations but also to account for cooperative effects between noisy and nonlinear dynamics. Often, this is achieved by a simple noise term in the membrane equation (current noise). However, there are ongoing discussions whether such current noise is justified or whether rather conductance noise should be introduced because it is closer to the natural origin of noise. Therefore, we have compared the effects of current and conductance noise in a neuronal model for subthreshold oscillations and action potential generation. We did not see any significant differences in the model behavior with respect to voltage traces, tuning curves of interspike intervals, interval distributions or frequency responses when the noise strength is adjusted. These findings indicate that simple current noise can give reasonable results in neuronal simulations with regard to physiological relevant noise effects. ?? 2006 Elsevier Ireland Ltd.

abstract = {Acinetobacter baumannii contains RND-family efflux systems AdeABC and AdeIJK, which pump out a wide range of antimicrobial compounds, as judged from the MIC changes occurring upon deletion of the responsible genes. However, these studies may miss changes because of the high backgrounds generated by the remaining pumps and by $\beta$-lactamases, and it is unclear how the activities of these pumps compare quantitatively with those of the well-studied AcrAB-TolC system of Escherichia coli. We expressed adeABC and adeIJK of A. baumannii, as well as E. coli acrAB, in an E. coli host from which acrAB was deleted. The A. baumannii pumps were functional in E. coli, and the MIC changes that were observed largely confirmed the substrate range already reported, with important differences. Thus, the AdeABC system pumped out all $\beta$-lactams, an activity that was often missed in deletion studies. When the expression level of the pump genes was adjusted to a similar level for a comparison with AcrAB-TolC, we found that both A. baumannii efflux systems pumped out a wide range of compounds, but AdeABC was less effective than AcrAB-TolC in the extrusion of lipophilic $\beta$-lactams, novobiocin, and ethidium bromide, although it was more effective at tetracycline efflux. AdeIJK was remarkably more effective than a similar level of AcrAB-TolC in the efflux of $\beta$-lactams, novobiocin, and ethidium bromide, although it was less so in the efflux of erythromycin. These results thus allow us to compare these efflux systems on a quantitative basis, if we can assume that the heterologous systems are fully functional in the E. coli host.},

The spontaneous appearance of synchronized oscillations results from the initiation by one or a small number of cells followed by the progressive recruitment of large numbers of neighboring neurons into the synchronized network activity. Synchronized network oscillations representative of slow- wave sleep, as well as absence seizures, were demonstrated to cease spontaneously at least in part through the persistent activation of a hyperpolarization-activated cation conductance. Block of this conductance resulted in oscillations that, once generalized, occur continuously.

abstract = {Neuronal output typically involves neurotransmitter release via axonal terminals; however, a subpopulation of neurons can also release neurotransmitters through vesicle-containing presynaptic dendrites. In the thalamus, local circuit inhibitory interneurons are a class of cells that can release $\gamma$-aminobutyric acid (GABA) via both axon terminals (termed F1 terminals) as well as presynaptic, vesicle-containing dendrites (termed F2 terminals). For example, in the visual thalamus, these F2 terminals are tightly coupled to the primary sensory afferents (axons of retinogeniculate neurons) that synapse onto thalamocortical relay neurons. The F2 terminals are primarily localized to distal dendrites of the interneurons, and in certain situations the excitation/output of F2 terminals can occur independent of somatic activity within the interneuron thereby allowing these F2 terminals to serve as independent input/output components giving rise to focal inhibition. On the other hand, somatically evoked Na+-dependent action potentials can backpropagate throughout the dendritic arbor of the interneuron. The transient depolarizations, or stronger somatically initiated events (e.g. activation of low threshold calcium transients) can initiate a backpropagating Ca2+-mediated potential that invades the dendritic arbor activating F2 terminals and leading to a global form of inhibition. These distinct types of output (focal versus global) could play an important role in the temporal as well as spatial roles of inhibition that in turn impacts thalamocortical information processing. {\textcopyright} 2014 Elsevier Ltd.},

The location of labeled corticothalamic terminals and their beaded varicosities were plotted, and the digital reconstructions were analyzed quantitatively to determine the extent of overlapping projections from the cortical injection sites. Among animals that received all tracer injections in SI cortex, tracer overlap in the thalamus varied according to the proximity of the cortical injection sites. Regardless of which combination of somatic representations were injected in SI, within each animal the amount of tracer overlap in POm was similar to that observed in VB, and a matched-sample statistical analysis failed to reveal significant differences in the proportion of the labeled regions that contained overlapping projections from the injected cortical sites. Among those animals in which the tracers were injected into the whisker representations of SI and SII, the amount of tracer overlap in the thalamus was not affected by the proximity of the cortical injection sites. Instead, tracer overlap appeared to be related to the degree of somatotopic correspondence. Furthermore, within each of these animals, the amount of tracer overlap in POm was similar to that found in the VB complex. These results indicate that POm has a well-defined topographic organization that is comparable to the degree of topography observed in the VB complex. ?? 2002 Elsevier Science B.V.

Intracellular recording in slices from different positions along the dorsal to ventral axis show differences in intrinsic properties such as subthreshold membrane potential oscillations (MPO), resonant frequency, and the presence of the hyperpolarization-activated cation current (h-current). The differences in intrinsic properties correlate with differences in grid cell spatial scale along the dorsal-ventral axis of mEC. Two sets of computational models have been proposed to explain the grid cell firing phenomena: oscillatory interference models and attractor-dynamic models. Both types of computational models are briefly reviewed, and cellular experimental evidence is interpreted and presented in the context of both models. The oscillatory interference model has variations that include an additive model and a multiplicative model. Experimental data on the voltage-dependence of oscillations presented here support the additive model. The additive model also simulates data from ventral neurons showing large spacing between grid firing fields within the limits of observed MPO frequencies. The interactions of h-current with synaptic modification suggest that the difference in intrinsic properties could also contribute to differences in grid cell properties due to attractor dynamics along the dorsal to ventral axis of mEC. Mechanisms of oscillatory interference and attractor dynamics may make complementary contributions to the properties of grid cell firing in entorhinal cortex.},

abstract = {Purpose: The brain is a highly interconnected neuronal assembly in which network analyses can greatly enlarge our knowledge on seizure generation. The cortico-thalamo-cortical network is the brain-network of interest in absence epilepsy. Here, network synchronization is assessed in a genetic absence model during 5. s long pre-ictal-{\textgreater} ictal transition periods. Method: 16 male WAG/Rij rats were equipped with multiple electrodes targeting layer 4 to 6 of the somatosensory-cortex, rostral and caudal RTN, VPM, anterior-(ATN) and posterior (Po) thalamic nucleus. Local field potentials measured during pre-ictal- {\textgreater} ictal transition and during control periods were subjected to time-frequency and pairwise phase consistency analysis. Results: Pre-ictally, all channels showed spike-wave discharge (SWD) precursor activity (increases in spectral power), which were earliest and most pronounced in the somatosensory cortex. The caudal RTN decoupled from VPM, Po and cortical layer 4. Strong increases in synchrony were found between cortex and thalamus during SWD. Although increases between cortex and VPM were seen in SWD frequencies and its harmonics, boarder spectral increases (6-48. Hz) were seen between cortex and Po. All thalamic nuclei showed increased phase synchronization with Po but not with VPM. Conclusion: Absence seizures are not sudden and unpredictable phenomena: the somatosensory cortex shows highest and earliest precursor activity. The pre-ictal decoupling of the caudal RTN might be a prerequisite of SWD generation. Po nucleus might be the primary thalamic counterpart to the somatosensory-cortex in the generation of the cortico-thalamic-cortical oscillations referred to as SWD. {\textcopyright} 2012 Elsevier Inc.},

abstract = {Body size and food intake of four female and three male captive Indian Ocean bottlenose dolphins, tursiops truncatus, were recorded regularly over a 10-year period. Growth of three captive-born female calves was also recorded. Growth of females parallelled that of South African bottlenose dolphins, tending toward an asymptote of c. 240 cm at 16 years of age. Growth of males was characterised by a secondary growth spurt at puberty between the ages of 10 and 12 years. Wild-caught females were approximately 10{\%} heavier for age than their South African conspecifics. The captive-born females were up to 50{\%} heavier than their African counterparts. Growth rates of females and males were 2.1-2.6 cm per year and 2.0-2.6 cm per year, respectively, between the ages of 3 and 16 years. Females were known to be reproductively mature at 11-13 years of age when lengths were between 227 and 238 cm. DNA fingerprinting of offspring and potential parents revealed that one of the three males was reproductively mature at 233 cm and another at either 222 or 226 cm. One of the males was sexually mature at the beginning of its secondary growth spurt at 10 or 11 years of age. Food intake of dolphins increased significantly with decreasing water temperature. It is suggested that variations in water temperature and food availability may play a role in governing body-size differences between t. truncatus populations},

abstract = {Four main theories on the pathophysiology of generalized absence seizures have been proposed. The “centrencephalic” theory, proposed in 1954, suggested that discharges originate from a deep-seated diffusely projecting subcortical pacemaker in the midline thalamus. This concept was refined in 1991 with the “thalamic clock” theory, implying that the reticular thalamic nucleus contains the pacemaker cells for the thalamic clock, imposing F its rhythm to the cortex. According to other investigators, however, the cortex seems to play a lead- ing role. They suggested that spike-wave discharges have a focal onset in the cortex and are gen- eralized through a rapid propagation. In the “corticoreticular” theory, postulated in 1968, spike- wave discharges are linked to the thalamocortical mechanisms that generate spindles. Rhythmic spindle oscillations generated in the thalamus are transformed into spike-wave discharges when the cortex is hyperexcitable. A 2002 study confirmed in epileptic rats that a functionally intact thalamocortical network is required for the generation of spike-wave discharges. The corticotha- lamic interrelationships were investigated by means of nonlinear association signal analyses of mul- tiple spike-wave discharges. This showed a consistent focus within the perioral region of the so- matosensory cortex. From this focus, seizure activity generalizes rapidly over the cortex. During the first cycles of the seizure the cortex drives the thalamus, while thereafter cortex and thalamus drive each other, thus amplifying and maintaining the rhythmic discharge. In this way the “corti- cal focus” theory for generalized absence epilepsy bridges cortical and thalamic theories},

abstract = {PURPOSE: Traditional methods of preclinical screening have predicted the effects of a putative antiepileptic drug (AED) against human absence seizures by testing its efficacy against clonic seizures in the high-dose pentylenetetrazole (PTZ) model. This high-dose PTZ model correctly predicted the efficacy of ethosuximide (ESM), benzodiazepines, and valproate (VPA) and the lack of efficacy of phenytoin (PHT) and carbamazepine (CBZ). However, the high-dose PTZ model erred in predictions for (a) phenobarbital (PB) (PTZ: efficacy; human: nonefficacy); (b) lamotrigine (LTG) (PTZ: nonefficacy; human: efficacy); (c) vigabatrin (VGB) (PTZ: nonefficacy; human: proabsence effect); and (d) tiagabine (TGB) (PTZ: efficacy; human: possible proabsence). It also appears to have erred in predictions for gabapentin (GBP) (PTZ: efficacy) and topiramate (TPM) (PTZ: efficacy). Because the lh/lh genetic model of absence seizures correctly predicted effects of ESM, clonazepam, VPA, PHT, CBZ, and PB against human absence seizures, we performed this study to test the predictive utility of the lh/lh model for LTG, VGB, TGB, GBP, and TPM. METHODS: Bipolar recording electrodes were implanted bilaterally into frontal neocortex of 8-week-old male lh/lh mice. With the exception of VGB, vehicle or drugs were administered intraperitoneally (i.p.) on alternating days, and an EEG was used to record effects on seizure frequency. With VGB, vehicle was administered i.p. on day 1, and gradually increasing doses of VGB were administered on successive days. Drug and vehicle effects were compared in corresponding 15-min epochs of the 150-min period after administration. RESULTS: LTG (4.8-144 micromol/kg) significantly (p {\textless} 0.04) reduced seizure frequency (by 65{\%}) compared with vehicle. In contrast, VGB (0.35-11 mmol/kg) and TGB (0.27-27 micromol/kg) significantly increased seizure frequency (300-700{\%}) and seizure duration (1,700-1,800{\%}; p {\textless} 0.001). GBP (18 micromol/kg to 1.8 mmol/kg) and TPM (8.9-295 micromol/kg) had no significant effect on seizure frequency. CONCLUSIONS: In contrast to the high-dose PTZ model, the lh/lh model correctly predicted the antiabsence effect of LTG, the possible proabsence effects of VGB and TGB, and the lack of effect of GBP and TPM. The lh/lh model appears to be superior to the high-dose PTZ model in predicting efficacy of putative AEDs against human absence seizures.},

abstract = {The cerebral cortex and thalamus constitute a unified oscillatory machine displaying different spontaneous rhythms that are dependent on the behavioral state of vigilance. In vivo multi-site recordings from a variety of neocortical areas and related thalamic nuclei in cat, including dual simultaneous intracellular recordings, demonstrate that corticofugal volleys are effective in synchronizing fast (20-50 Hz) and low-frequency ({\textless} 15 Hz) oscillations in thalamocortical networks, characterizing activated and de-afferented states. (i) Fast spontaneous oscillations depend on the depolarization of thalamic and cortical cells and appear in a sustained manner during waking and REM sleep. Corticothalamic neurons, discharging high-frequency (400 Hz) spike-bursts at 30-40 Hz, are good candidates to synchronize fast oscillations in reentrant thalamocortical loops. Weakly synchronized, fast spontaneous oscillations may be reset and become robustly coherent after relevant sensory stimuli in waking or internal signals during the dreaming state. (ii) During quiescent sleep, the long-range synchronization of brain electrical activity results from synchronous hyperpolarizations in forebrain neurons. The corticothalamic inputs during the depolarizing component of the slow oscillation ({\textless} 1 Hz) are effective in grouping the thalamic-generated sleep rhythms (spindles at 7-14 Hz and delta at 1-4 Hz) into complex wave-sequences. These inputs also control the shape of spindles, and favor the long-range synchronization and nearly simultaneous appearance of spindles. (iii) The cortical control of thalamic activity is also demonstrated in spike-wave-seizures developing from sleep patterns. More than half of thalamocortical neurons are silent during spike-wave seizures, being tonically hyperpolarized, and display IPSPs (closely related to the paroxysmal depolarizing shifts of cortical cells) that are determined by the pattern of activities in thalamic reticular cells. All these data congruently show the power of cortical control upon thalamic oscillators.},

In vivo extracellular and intracellular recordings were performed from thalamocortical (TC) neurones in a genetic model of absence epilepsy (genetic absence epilepsy rats from Strasbourg) during spontaneous spike and wave discharges (SWDs). 2. Extracellularly recorded single units (n = 14) fired either a single action potential or a high frequency burst of up to three action potentials, concomitantly with the spike component of the spike-wave complex. 3. Three main events characterized the intracellular activity of twenty-six out of twenty-eight TC neurones during SWDs: a small amplitude tonic hyperpolarization that was present throughout the SWD, rhythmic sequences of EPSP/IPSPs occurring concomitantly with the spike-wave complexes, and a small tonic depolarization at the end of the SWD. The rhythmic IPSPs, but not the tonic hyperpolarization, were mediated by activation of GABAA receptors since they reversed in polarity at -68 mV and appeared as depolarizing events when recording with KCl-filled electrodes. 4. The intracellular activity of the remaining two TC neurones consisted of rhythmic low threshold Ca2+ potentials, with a few EPSP/IPSP sequences present at the start of the SWD. 5. These results obtained in a well-established genetic model of absence epilepsy do not support the hypothesis that the intracellular activity of TC neurones during SWDs involves rhythmic sequences of GABAB IPSPs and low threshold Ca2+ potentials.},

abstract = {We have selected a strain of rats and designated it the Genetic Absence Epilepsy Rat from Strasbourg (GAERS). In this strain, 100{\%} of the animals present recurrent generalized non-convulsive seizures characterized by bilateral and synchronous spike-and-wave discharges accompanied with behavioural arrest, staring and sometimes twitching of the vibrissae. Spontaneous SWD (7-11 cps, 300-1,000 microV, 0.5-75 sec) start and end abruptly on a normal background EEG. They usually occur at a mean frequency of 1.5 per min when the animals are in a state of quiet wakefulness. Drugs effective against absence seizures in humans (ethosuccimide, trimethadione, valproate, benzodiazepines) suppress the SWD dose-dependently, whereas drugs specific for convulsive or focal seizures (carbamazepine, phenytoin) are ineffective. SWD are increased by epileptogenic drugs inducing petit mal-like seizures, such as pentylenetetrazol, gamma-hydroxybutyrate, THIP and penicillin. Depth EEG recordings and lesion experiments show that SWD in GAERs depend on cortical and thalamic structures with a possible rhythmic triggering by the lateral thalamus. Most neurotransmitters are involved in the control of SWD (dopamine, noradrenaline, NMDA, acetylcholine), but GABA and gamma-hydroxybutyrate (GHB) seem to play a critical role. SWD are genetically determined with an autosomal dominant inheritance. The variable expression of SWD in offsprings from GAERS x control reciprocal crosses may be due to the existence of multiple genes. Neurophysiological, behavioural, pharmacological and genetic studies demonstrate that spontaneous SWD in GAERS fulfill all the requirements for an experimental model of absence epilepsy. As the mechanisms underlying absence epilepsy in humans are still unknown, the analysis of the genetic thalamocortical dysfunction in GAERS may be fruitful in investigations of the pathogenesis of generalized non-convulsive seizures.},

abstract = {Our objective was to evaluate the brain regions showing increased and decreased metabolism in patients at the time of generalized bursts of epileptic discharges in order to understand their mechanism of generation and effect on brain function. By recording the electroencephalogram during the functional MRI, changes in the blood oxygenation level-dependent signal were obtained in response to epileptic discharges observed in the electroencephalogram of 15 patients with idiopathic generalized epilepsy. A group analysis was performed to determine the regions of positive (activation) and negative (deactivation) blood oxygenation level-dependent responses that were common to the patients. Activations were found bilaterally and symmetrically in the thalamus, mesial midfrontal region, insulae, and midline and bilateral cerebellum and on the borders of the lateral ventricles. Deactivations were bilateral and symmetrical in the anterior frontal and parietal regions and in the posterior cingulate gyri and were seen in the left posterior temporal region. Activations in thalamus and midfrontal regions confirm known involvement of these regions in the generation or spread of generalized epileptic discharges. Involvement of the insulae in generalized discharges had not previously been described. Cerebellar activation is not believed to reflect the generation of discharges. Deactivations in frontal and parietal regions remarkably followed the pattern of the default state of brain function. Thalamocortical activation and suspension of the default state may combine to cause the actual state of reduced responsiveness observed in patients during spike-and-wave discharges. This brief lapse of responsiveness may therefore not result only from the epileptic discharge but also from its effect on normal brain function.},

These dynamics are characterized by translaminar assemblies of neurons whose activity synchronizes rhythmically in space and time. How different cortical layers influence the formation of these spontaneous cellular assemblies is poorly understood. We found that excitatory neurons in supragranular and infragranular layers have distinct roles in the regulation of intrinsic low-frequency oscillations in mice in vivo. Optogenetic activation of infragranular neurons generated network activity that resembled spontaneous events, whereas photoinhibition of these same neurons substantially attenuated slow ongoing dynamics. In contrast, light activation and inhibition of supragranular cells had modest effects on spontaneous slow activity. This study represents, to the best of our knowledge, the first causal demonstration that excitatory circuits located in distinct cortical layers differentially control spontaneous low-frequency dynamics.},

abstract = {The electroresponsive properties of guinea-pig thalamic neurones were studied using an in vitro slice preparation. A total of 650 cells were recorded intracellularly comprising all regions of the thalamus; of these 229 fulfilled our criterion for recording stability and were used as the data base for this report. The resting membrane potential for thirty-four representative neurones which were analysed in detail was -64 +/- 5 mV (mean +/- S.D.), input resistance 42 +/- 18 M omega, and action potential amplitude 80 +/- 7 mV. Intracellular staining with horseradish peroxidase and Lucifer Yellow revealed that the recorded cells had different morphology. In some their axonal trajectory characterized them as thalamo-cortical relay cells. Two main types of neuronal firing were observed. From a membrane potential negative to -60 mV, anti- or orthodromic and direct activation generated a single burst of spikes, consisting of a low-threshold spike (l.t.s.) of low amplitude and a set of fast superimposed spikes. Tonic repetitive firing was observed if the neurones were activated from a more positive membrane potential; this was a constant finding in all but two of the cells which fulfilled the stability criteria. The l.t.s. response was totally inactivated at membrane potentials positive to -55 mV. As the membrane was hyperpolarized from this level the amplitude of the l.t.s. increased and became fully developed at potentials negative to -70 mV. This increase is due to a de-inactivation of the ionic conductance generating this response. After activation the l.t.s. showed refractoriness for approximately 170 ms. Deinactivation of l.t.s. is a voltage- and time-dependent process; full de-inactivation after a step hyperpolarization to maximal l.t.s. amplitude (-75 to -80 mV) requires 150-180 ms. Membrane depolarization positive to -55 mV generated sudden sustained depolarizing 'plateau potentials', capable of supporting repetitive firing (each action potential being followed by a marked after-hyperpolarization, a.h.p.). The a.h.p. and the plateau potential controlled the voltage trajectory during the interspike interval and, with the fast spike, constitute a functional state where the thalamic neurone displayed oscillatory properties. Frequency-current (f-I) plots from different initial levels of membrane potential were obtained by the application of square current pulses of long duration (2s). From resting membrane potential and from hyperpolarized levels a rather stereotyped onset firing rate was observed due to the presence of the l.t.s.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)},

@article{Coenen1992b,
abstract = {In this review, the main characteristics of genetic models of absence epilepsy, in particular with respect to WAG/Rij rats, are presented. Genetic models are important and relevant, since evidence exists that these models mimic spontaneously occurring human epilepsy more than models in which epilepsy is artificially induced. Genetic models can be divided into models in which seizures are elicited and into those in which epilepsy appears without any sensory stimulation. The majority of genetic models show the absence type of epilepsy; during the last few years, we and others have noticed that rats of various strains exhibit spontaneously occurring spike-wave discharges in the EEG. Among the strains highly affected is the WAG/Rij strain, which is a fully inbred strain. Individuals are homozygous and because of this property, genetic studies are meaningful. Electrophysiological studies have indicated that abnormal discharges in the cortical EEG are generalized and that the hippocampus is not involved. Parts of the thalamus, together with the thalamic reticular nucleus, apparently act as a pacemaker for the abnormal discharges. There is a circadian modulation in the number of spike-wave discharges. Discharges mainly occur during intermediate levels of vigilance such as passive wakefulness and light slow-wave sleep and at transitions of sleep states. Pharmacological studies with clinically effective antiepileptic drugs have shown a close agreement in seizure response between man and rat. Studies with new compounds have emphasized the role of the GABAergic and glutamatergic system in this type of epilepsy. Particularly striking is the role of the GABAergic system. GABA agonists enhance and GABA antagonists reduce the occurrence of spike-wave discharges, which deviates from the effects of GABAergic drugs in non-convulsive epilepsy. Even more striking is the role of the benzodiazepines, generally seen as GABA agonists; these drugs do not act as such in absence epilepsy since they reduce spike-wave discharges. Also good evidence for an involvement of other neurotransmitters such as noradrenaline, dopamine and opioid peptides exists in absence epilepsy. Genetic data obtained from the WAG/Rij model for absence epilepsy show a relatively simple pattern of inheritance with one gene determining whether an individual is epileptic or not, and with other genes regulating the number and duration of seizures. This is in good agreement with the more restricted human data. Cognitive studies have shown two important features of epilepsy in the WAG/Rij strain: modulation of the number of spike-wave discharges by mental or physical activity and on the other hand, the disruption of cognitive activity by spike-wave discharges. Finally, it is concluded from the aberrant shape of visual evoked potentials obtained during spike-wave activity that sensory processing during spike-wave discharges is different from that occurring during normal states of vigilance. These differences may correlate with changes in cognitive functioning during absences. ?? 1992.},

abstract = {Attempting to understand how the brain, as a whole, might be organized seems, for the first time, to be a serious topic of inquiry. One aspect of its neuronal organization that seems particularly central to global function is the rich thalamocortical interconnectivity, and most particularly the reciprocal nature of the thalamocortical neuronal loop function. Moreover, the interaction between the specific and non-specific thalamic loops suggests that rather than a gate into the brain, the thalamus represents a hub from which any site in the cortex can communicate with any other such site or sites. The goal of this paper is to explore the basic assumption that large-scale, temporal coincidence of specific and non-specific thalamic activity generates the functional states that characterize human cognition.},

abstract = {Primary sensory cortical areas receive information through multiple thalamic channels. In the rodent whisker system, lemniscal and paralemniscal thalamocortical projections, from the ventral posteromedial nucleus (VPM) and posterior medial nucleus (POm) respectively, carry distinct types of sensory information to cortex. Little is known about how these separate streams of activity are parsed and integrated within the neocortical microcircuit. We used quantitative laser scanning photostimulation to probe the organization of functional thalamocortical and ascending intracortical projections in the mouse barrel cortex. To map the thalamocortical projections, we recorded from neocortical excitatory neurons while stimulating VPM or POm. Neurons in layers (L)4, L5, and L6A received dense input from thalamus (L4, L5B, and L6A from VPM; and L5A from POm), whereas L2/3 neurons rarely received thalamic input. We further mapped the lemniscal and paralemniscal circuits from L4 and L5A to L2/3. Lemniscal L4 neurons targeted L3 within a column. Paralemniscal L5A neurons targeted a superficial band (thickness, 60 mum) of neurons immediately below L1, defining a functionally distinct L2 in the mouse barrel cortex. L2 neurons received input from lemniscal L3 cells and paralemniscal L5A cells spread over multiple columns. Our data indicate that lemniscal and paralemniscal information is segregated into interdigitated cortical layers.},

abstract = {The contribution of acetylcholine to psychiatric illnesses remains an area of active research. For example, increased understanding of mechanisms underlying cholinergic modulation of cortical function has provided insight into attentional dysfunction in schizophrenia. Acetylcholine normally enhances cortical sensitivity to external stimuli and decreases corticocortical communication, increasing focused attention; however, increases in ACh signaling can lead to symptoms related to anxiety and depression. For example, while stress-induced ACh release can result in adaptive responses to environmental stimuli, chronic elevations in cholinergic signaling may produce maladaptive behaviors. Here, we review several innovations in human imaging, molecular genetics and physiological control of circuits that have begun to identify mechanisms linking altered cholinergic neuromodulation to schizophrenia and depression. {\textcopyright} 2014 Elsevier Ltd.},

The cholinergic agonist carbachol and the muscarinic antagonist scopolamine were injected in the NB and RT in the doses of 0.55 and 5.5 nmol while the EEG was recorded. Carbachol injected in the NB decreased the number and the mean duration of SWDs. Scopolamine alone had no influence on SWDs, but could antagonize the effects of carbachol if administered simultaneously in NB. Injections of carbachol in the RT inhibited the occurrence of SWDs, but did not affect the mean duration. Scopolamine administered in the RT had no influence on seizure activity. It is concluded that cholinergic stimulation of the NB or the RT inhibits the cortical synchronous activity characterizing SWDs. ?? 2009 Elsevier Ireland Ltd. All rights reserved.},

abstract = {Primary somatosensory cortex (S1) receives two distinct classes of thalamocortical input via the lemniscal and paralemniscal pathways, the former via ventral posterior medial nucleus (VPM), and the latter, from the posterior medial nucleus (POm). These projections have been described as parallel thalamocortical pathways. Although the VPM thalamocortical projection has been studied in depth, several details of the POm projection to S1 are unknown. We studied the synaptic properties and anatomical features in the mouse of the projection from POm to all layers of S1 and to layer 4 of secondary somatosensory cortex (S2). Neurons in S1 responded to stimulation of POm with what has been termed Class 2 properties (paired-pulse facilitation, small initial excitatory postsynaptic potentials (EPSPs), a graded activation profile, and a metabotropic receptor component; thought to be modulatory), whereas neurons in layer 4 of S2 responded with Class 1A properties (paired-pulse depression, large initial EPSPs, an all-or-none activation profile, and no metabotropic receptor component, thought to be a main information input). Also, labeling from POm produced small boutons in S1, whereas both small and large boutons were found in S2. Our data suggest that the lemniscal and paralemniscal projections should not be thought of as parallel information pathways to S1 and that the paralemniscal projection may instead provide modulatory inputs to S1.},

abstract = {During various states of vigilance, brain oscillations are grouped together through reciprocal connections between the neocortex and thalamus. The coherent activity in corticothalamic networks, under the control of brainstem and forebrain modulatory systems, requires investigations in intact-brain animals. During behavioral states associated with brain disconnection from the external world, the large-scale synchronization of low-frequency oscillations is accompanied by the inhibition of synaptic transmission through thalamocortical neurons. Despite the coherent oscillatory activity, on the functional side there is dissociation between the thalamus and neocortex during slow-wave sleep. While dorsal thalamic neurons undergo inhibitory processes due to the prolonged spike-bursts of thalamic reticular neurons, the cortex displays, periodically, a rich spontaneous activity and preserves the capacity to process internally generated signals that dominate the state of sleep. In vivo experiments using simultaneous intracellular recordings from thalamic and cortical neurons show that short-term plasticity processes occur after prolonged and rhythmic spike-bursts fired by thalamic and cortical neurons during slow-wave sleep oscillations. This may serve to support resonant phenomena and reorganize corticothalamic circuitry, determine which synaptic modifications, formed during the waking state, are to be consolidated and generate a peculiar kind of dreaming mentation. In contrast to the long-range coherent oscillations that occur at low frequencies during slow-wave sleep, the sustained fast oscillations that characterize alert states are synchronized over restricted territories and are associated with discrete and differentiated patterns of conscious events.

L-689,660 had a low ratio (34) of pKD (apparent) values for the displacement of binding of the antagonist ([3H]-N-methylscopolamine ([3H]-NMS) compared with the displacement of the agonist [3H]-oxotremorine-M ([3H]-Oxo-M), in rat cerebral cortex. Low NMS/Oxo-M ratios have been shown previously to be a characteristic of compounds that are low efficacy partial agonists with respect to stimulation of phosphatidyl inositol turnover in the cerebral cortex. 2. L-689,660 showed no muscarinic receptor subtype selectivity in radioligand binding assays but showed functional selectivity in pharmacological assays. At M1 muscarinic receptors in the rat superior cervical ganglion, L-689,660 was a potent (pEC50 7.3 +/- 0.2) full agonist in comparison with (+/-)-muscarine. At M3 receptors in the guinea-pig ileum myenteric plexus-longitudinal muscle or in trachea, L-689,660 was again a potent agonist (pEC50 7.5 +/- 0.2 and 7.7 +/- 0.3 respectively) but had a lower maximum response than carbachol.

Two patients with a low incidence of spike-and-wave activity had a random pattern of occurrence; the other 17 showed one of three types of time modulation. The latter can be explained by the interaction of two modulative processes, one with a period of about 100 minutes and the other of approximately 24 hours. The pattern observed depends on the phase angle of the two cyclic processes.

The whole-night time-frequency coherence maps between EEG (C3, C4) and LFP (LT, RT) showed specific coherence patterns during non-rapid eye movement (NREM) sleep. Pooled coherence in the NREM stage was significant in slow, delta, theta and spindle frequency ranges. The spindle oscillations had the highest coherence (0.17-0.58) in the homolateral hemisphere.

In addition, disruption of modulators often translates into disabling disorders of executive behavior. However, modulation in thalamic nuclei such as the midline and intralaminar groups, which are interconnected with forebrain executive regions, has received little attention compared to sensory nuclei. Thalamic modulators are heterogeneous in regards to their origin, the neurotransmitter they use, and the effect on thalamic cells. Modulators also share some features, such as having small terminal boutons and activating metabotropic receptors on the cells they contact. I will review anatomical and physiological data on thalamic modulators with these goals: first, determine to what extent the evidence supports similar modulator functions across thalamic nuclei; and second, discuss the current evidence on modulation in the midline and intralaminar nuclei in relation to their role in executive function.},

abstract = {The exact timing of cortical afferent activity is instrumental for the correct coding and retrieval of internal and external stimuli. Thalamocortical inputs represent the most significant subcortical pathway to the cortex, but the precise timing and temporal variability of thalamocortical activity is not known. To examine this question, we studied the phase of thalamic action potentials relative to cortical oscillations and established correlations among phase, the nuclear location of the thalamocortical neurons, and the frequency of cortical activity. The phase of thalamic action potentials depended on the exact frequency of the slow cortical oscillation both on long (minutes) and short (single wave) time scales. Faster waves were accompanied by phase advancement in both cases. Thalamocortical neurons located in different nuclei fired at significantly different phases of the slow waves but were active at a similar phase of spindle oscillations. Different thalamic nuclei displayed distinct burst patterns. Bursts with a higher number of action potentials displayed progressive phase advancement in a nucleus-specific manner. Thalamic neurons located along nuclear borders were characterized by mixed burst and phase properties. Our data demonstrate that the temporal relationship between cortical and thalamic activity is not fixed but displays dynamic changes during oscillatory activity. The timing depends on the precise location and exact activity of thalamocortical cells and the ongoing cortical network pattern. This variability of thalamic output and its coupling to cortical activity can enable thalamocortical neurons to actively participate in the coding and retrieval of cortical signals.},

abstract = {The posterior nuclear complex of the thalamus in rhesus, pigtailed and squirrel monkeys consists of the combined suprageniculate-limitans nucleus and an ill defined region of heterogeneous cell types extending anteriorly from the dorsal lobe of the medial geniculate body towards the posterior pole of the ventral nuclear complex. This region is referred to as the posterior nucleus. It is directly continuous with the ventroposteroinferior nucleus. The cortical projections of each of these nuclei, together with those of the adjacent ventral, pulvinar and medial geniculate complexes, have been studied by means of the autoradiographic tracing technique. The suprageniculate-limitans nucleus, the main input to which is the superior colliculus, projects upon the granular insular area of the cortex. The medial portion of the posterior nucleus projects to the retroinsular field lying posterior to the second somatic sensory area. There is clinical and electrophysiological evidence to suggest that the retroinsular area may form part of a central pain pathway. The lateral portion of the posterior nucleus which is closely related to certain elements of the medial geniculate complex, projects to the postauditory cortical field. The ventroposterioinferior nucleus, which may be involved in vestibular function, projects to the dysgranular insular field. The principal medial geniculate nucleus can be subdivided into a ventral division that projects to field AI of the auditory cortex and a dorsal division that merges with the posterior nucleus; it is further subdivided into an anterodorsal component that projects to two fields on the superior temporal gyrus, together with a posterodorsal component in which separate cell populations project to areas lying anterior and medial to AI. The magnocellular medial geniculate nucleus, sometimes considered a part of the posterior complex, appears to project diffusely to layer I of all the auditory fields. The auditory fields are bounded on three sides by the projection field of the medial nucleus of the pulvinar which also extends into the upper end of the lateral sulcus to bound the fields receiving fibers from the posterior nucleus. The topography of the areas receiving fibers from the posterior, medial geniculate and pulvinar complexes, taken in conjunction with the rotation of the primate temporal lobe, permits all of these fields to be compared with similar, better known areas in the cat brain.},

abstract = {Objectives: This review aims to offer a critical account of recent scientific developments relevant to the hypothesis which Pierre Gloor proposed in the 1970s for the generation of spike and wave discharges (SWDs) of primary generalized absence seizures. Results: According to this hypothesis SWDs develop in the same circuits, which normally generate sleep spindles, by an initially cortical transformation of one every two or more spindle waves to a 'spike' component of SWDs, while the next one or more spindle waves are eliminated and replaced by a slow negative wave. This hypothesis was based on experiments in feline generalized penicillin epilepsy showing the possibility of transition from spindles to SWDs, when cortical neurons become hyper-responsive to thalamocortical volleys, which normally induce spindles, and thus engage feedback cortical inhibition, rebound excitation, recurrent intracortical dissemination of excitation during the 'spike' and strong excitation of thalamus for further augmentation of a brain wide synchronous oscillation. In the 1980s, electrophysiological studies in vitro and in vivo revealed the basic features of spindle rhythm generation by neurons in nucleus reticularis thalami and thalamocortical-corticothalamic oscillatory reverberations. Conclusions: In the light of this knowledge, experimental studies in several genetic and pharmacological animal models of absence seizures, clinical observations and theoretical studies in computer models have considered, tested, modified and challenged this hypothesis. It may still be found useful in the era of dynamic digital EEG analysis of SWDs and its current sources. (C) 2000 Elsevier Science Ireland Ltd.},

abstract = {The properties of voltage-dependent calcium currents were compared in thalamic neurons acutely dissociated from a rat model of absence epilepsy, designated as Genetic Absence Epilepsy Rat from Strasbourg (GAERS), and from a Nonepileptic Control strain (NEC). Two populations of neurons were isolated: thalamocortical relay neurons of the nucleus ventrobasalis (VB) and neurons of the nucleus reticularis (RT) of the thalamus. Whole-cell patch-clamp analysis demonstrated an increase in the amplitude of the calcium (Ca2+) current with a low threshold of activation (IT) in RT neurons of GAERS in comparison to that of the seizure-free rat strain (-198 +/- 19 pA and -128 +/- 14 pA, respectively), whereas the sustained component (IL) was not significantly different. The kinetic properties, voltage dependence, and basic pharmacological sensitivity of the Ca2+ conductances were similar in the two populations of neurons. The amplitude of both IT and IL in RT neurons increased after birth, and differences in IT between GAERS and NEC attained significance after postnatal day 11. At corresponding ages, the Ca2+ currents in VB thalamocortical relay neurons were not altered in GAERS in comparison to those in NEC. We conclude that the selective increase in IT of RT neurons enhances the probability of recurrent intrathalamic burst activity, thereby strengthening the synchronizing mechanisms in thalamocortical systems, and, as such, represents a possible primary neuronal dysfunction that relates to the pathological increase in synchronization underlying the generation of bilateral and synchronous spike and wave discharges (SWDs) in an established genetic model of generalized epilepsy.},

abstract = {Stochastic resonance is said to be observed when increases in levels of unpredictable fluctuations--e.g., random noise--cause an increase in a metric of the quality of signal transmission or detection performance, rather than a decrease. This counterintuitive effect relies on system nonlinearities and on some parameter ranges being "suboptimal". Stochastic resonance has been observed, quantified, and described in a plethora of physical and biological systems, including neurons. Being a topic of widespread multidisciplinary interest, the definition of stochastic resonance has evolved significantly over the last decade or so, leading to a number of debates, misunderstandings, and controversies. Perhaps the most important debate is whether the brain has evolved to utilize random noise in vivo, as part of the "neural code". Surprisingly, this debate has been for the most part ignored by neuroscientists, despite much indirect evidence of a positive role for noise in the brain. We explore some of the reasons for this and argue why it would be more surprising if the brain did not exploit randomness provided by noise--via stochastic resonance or otherwise--than if it did. We also challenge neuroscientists and biologists, both computational and experimental, to embrace a very broad definition of stochastic resonance in terms of signal-processing "noise benefits", and to devise experiments aimed at verifying that random variability can play a functional role in the brain, nervous system, or other areas of biology.},

abstract = {Spindle oscillations (7-14 Hz) appear in the thalamus and cortex during early stages of sleep. They are generated by the combination of intrinsic properties and connectivity patterns of thalamic neurons and distributed to cortical territories by thalamocortical axons. The corticothalamic feedback is a major factor in producing coherent spatiotemporal maps of spindle oscillations in widespread thalamic territories. Here we have investigated the spatiotemporal patterns of spontaneously occurring and evoked spindles by means of multisite field potential and unit recordings in intact cortex and decorticated animals. We show that (1) spontaneous spindle oscillations are synchronized over large cortical areas during natural sleep and barbiturate anesthesia; (2) under barbiturate anesthesia, the cortical coherence is not disrupted by transection of intracortical synaptic linkages; (3) in intact cortex animals, spontaneously occurring barbiturate spindle sequences occur nearly simultaneously over widespread thalamic territories; (4) in the absence of cortex, the spontaneous spindle oscillations throughout the thalamus are less organized, but the local coherence (within 2-4 mm) is still maintained; and (5) spindling propagation is observed in intact cortex animals only when elicited by low intensity cortical stimulation, applied shortly before the initiation of a spontaneous spindle sequence; propagation velocities are between 1 and 3 mm/sec, measured in the anteroposterior axis of the thalamus; increasing the intensity of cortical stimulation triggers spindle oscillations, which start simultaneously in all leads. We propose that, in vivo, the coherence of spontaneous spindle oscillations in corticothalamic networks is attributable to the combined action of continuous background corticothalamic input initiating spindle sequences in several thalamic sites at the same time and divergent corticothalamic and intrathalamic connectivity.},

abstract = {Epileptic seizures represent dysfunctional neural networks dominated by excessive and/or hypersynchronous activity. Recent progress in the field has outlined two concepts regarding mechanisms of seizure generation, or ictogenesis. First, all seizures, even those associated with what have historically been thought of as 'primary generalized' epilepsies, appear to originate in local microcircuits and then propagate from that initial ictogenic zone. Second, seizures propagate through cerebral networks and engage microcircuits in distal nodes, a process that can be weakened or even interrupted by suppressing activity in such nodes. We describe various microcircuit motifs, with a special emphasis on one that has been broadly implicated in several epilepsies: feed-forward inhibition. Furthermore, we discuss how, in the dynamic network in which seizures propagate, focusing on circuit 'choke points' remote from the initiation site might be as important as that of the initial dysfunction, the seizure 'focus'.},

abstract = {Purpose: Generalized spike and wave discharges (SWD) are generated within the cortico-thalamo-cortical system. However the exact interactions between cortex and different thalamic nuclei needed for the generation and maintenance of SWD are still to be elucidated. This study aims to shed more light on these interactions via multisite cortical and thalamic local-field-potential recordings. Methods: WAG/Rij rats were equipped with multiple electrodes targeting layers 4 to 6 of the somatosensory-cortex, rostral and caudal RTN, VPM, anterior (ATN)- and posterior (Po) thalamic nucleus. The maximal-association-strength between signals was calculated for pre-ictal. →. ictal transition periods and in control periods using non-linear-association-analysis. Dynamics of changes in coupling-direction and time-delays between channels were analyzed. Results: Earliest and strongest increases in coupling-strength were seen between cortical layers 5/6 and Po. Other thalamic nuclei became later involved in SWD activity. During the first 500. ms of SWDs the cortex guided most thalamic nuclei while cortex and Po kept a bidirectional crosstalk. Most thalamic nuclei started to guide the Po until the end of the SWD. While the rostral RTN showed increased coupling with Po, the caudal RTN decoupled. Instead, it directed its activity to the rostral RTN. Conclusions: Next to the focal cortical instigator zone of SWDs, the Po seems crucial for their occurrence. This nucleus shows early increases in coupling and is the only nucleus which keeps a bidirectional crosstalk to the cortex within the first 500. ms of SWDs. Other thalamic nuclei seem to have only a function in SWD maintenance. Rostral and caudal-RTN have opposite roles in SWD occurrence. {\textcopyright} 2012 Elsevier Inc.},

Cortical areas communicate with each other by means of direct corticocortical and corticothalamocortical pathways, often organized in parallel. We distinguish these functionally, stressing that the transthalamic pathways are class 1 (formerly known as "driver") pathways capable of transmitting information, whereas the direct pathways vary, being either class 2 (formerly known as "modulator") or class 1. The transthalamic pathways provide a thalamic gate that can be open or closed (and otherwise more subtly modulated), and these inputs to the thalamus are generally branches of axons with motor functions. Thus the transthalamic corticocortical pathways that can be gated carry information about the cortical processing in one cortical area and also about the motor instructions currently being issued from that area and copied to other cortical areas.},

Bilateral thalamic lesions of the anterior nuclei, the ventromedial nuclei, the posterior area, or lesion of the midline nuclei did not suppress cortical SWD.

Investigation of the primary genetically-determined defect responsible for GAERS epilepsy revealed the following abnormalities: (1) increased effectiveness of AMPA receptors dependent glutamate-mediated transmission; (2) impairment of GABA-mediated transmission in the neocortex; (3) increased amplitude of the voltage-dependent low-threshold Ca2+-current (I(T)) in the nRt.

abstract = {All neocortical areas receive inputs from and project back to the thalamus. It is often said that the corticothalamic projections are organized in a way that reciprocates the spatial distribution of thalamocortical pathways. The present review examines to what extent this rule of reciprocity is actually supported by the most recent neuroanatomical data, particularly those relating to the central organization of the vibrissal sensory system in the rat. A critical survey of previous studies is made and new results are presented concerning the fine-grained organization of corticothalamic projections in this sensory system. Together, prior results and the present set of new data confirm the existence of both, reciprocal and nonreciprocal patterns of corticothalamic connectivity. This conclusion leads us to propose that the spatial organization of corticothalamic connections complies with a more fundamental rule, the rule of parity, from which reciprocity follows as a general, but not obligatory consequence. The rule of parity states that the distribution of corticothalamic projections across and within the thalamic nuclei is determined by the branching patterns of the different classes of prethalamic afferents. The anatomical, developmental and physiological consequences of this rule are discussed. The rule of parity suggests that, according to the behavioral context, both prethalamic and corticothalamic pathways may function in a feedback mode.},

Here we report that both trial-to-trial variability and faithfulness of auditory cortical stimulus representations depend critically on brain state. A frozen amplitude-modulated white noise stimulus was repeatedly presented while recording neuronal populations and local field potentials (LFPs) in auditory cortex of urethane-anesthetized rats. An information-theoretic measure was used to predict neuronal spiking activity from either the stimulus envelope or simultaneously recorded LFP. Evoked LFPs and spiking more faithfully followed high-frequency temporal modulations when the cortex was in a desynchronized state. In the synchronized state, neural activity was poorly predictable from the stimulus envelope, but the spiking of individual neurons could still be predicted from the ongoing LFP. Our results suggest that although auditory cortical activity remains coordinated as a population in the synchronized state, the ability of continuous auditory stimuli to control this activity is greatly diminished.},

Here, we combined optogenetics, fMRI, electrophysiology, and video-EEG monitoring to characterize the central thalamus-driven global brain networks responsible for switching brain state. 40 and 100 Hz stimulations of central thalamus caused widespread activation of forebrain, including frontal cortex, sensorimotor cortex, and striatum, and transitioned the brain to a state of arousal in asleep rats. In contrast, 10 Hz stimulation evoked significantly less activation of forebrain, inhibition of sensory cortex, and behavioral arrest. To investigate possible mechanisms underlying the frequency-dependent cortical inhibition, we performed recordings in zona incerta, where 10, but not 40, Hz stimulation evoked spindle-like oscillations. Importantly, suppressing incertal activity during 10 Hz central thalamus stimulation reduced the evoked cortical inhibition. These findings identify key brain-wide dynamics underlying central thalamus arousal regulation.},

abstract = {Rhythmical oscillation of thalamic neuronal populations occurs under physiological conditions and in several disease states. In the present experiments we examined the network properties of population rhythmicity and the possible involvement of N-methyl-D-aspartate receptors in the frequency regulation and maintenance of rhythmic thalamic bursts. Multisite recording of neuronal activity and local microinjections of drugs were performed on the freely moving rat. Rhythmic thalamic population bursts at 6 to 9 Hz and concurrent neocortical high voltage spike-and-wave spindles were observed during awake immobility, with the thalamic rhythm leading the neocortical high voltage spindle. Even though all individual thalamocortical neurons fired in a phase-locked manner to the high-voltage spindle, the majority discharged at a significantly lower frequency than that of the population (multiunit) activity. In contrast, neurons in the nucleus reticularis thalami discharged at the frequency of the population bursts. Neurons in the extrapyramidal system and neocortex but not the hippocampal formation also fired in a phase-locked manner to the high-voltage spindle. Systemic administration or local microinjection of either non-competititve or competititve N-methyl-D-aspartate blockers (ketamine or ap-5) slowed the frequency of thalamic multiunit bursts and associated high-voltage spindles from 8 to 2 Hz, or completely blocked rhythmicity. Unilateral thalamic injection of ketamine or ap-5 resulted in a suppression of the amplitude of high-voltage spindles in the injected hemisphere. It is concluded that thalamic rhythmicity is not due to the 'pacemaker' properties of thalamic cells but is rather an emergent property of the relay thalamus-nucleus reticularis network. Furthermore, we hypothesize that the frequency of network oscillation is regulated by the interplay between two major classes of voltage-dependent conductances in the thalamocortical cells: low-threshold calcium channels and high-threshold N-methyl-D-aspartate channels.},

abstract = {The WAG/Rij model is a well characterized and validated genetic animal epilepsy model in which the for absence epilepsy highly characteristic spike-wave discharges (SWDs) develop spontaneously. In this review we discuss first some older and many new studies, with an emphasis on pharmacological and neurochemical studies towards the role of GABA and glutamate and the ion channels involved in the pathological firing patterns. Next, new insights and highlights from the last 5-10 years of reaearch in WAG/Rij rats are discussed. First, early environmental factors modulate SWD characteristics and antiepileptogenesis is possible. Also new is that the classically assumed association between sleep spindles and SWDs seems no longer valid as an explanatory role for the occurrence of SWDs in the genetic rodent models. A role of cortical and thalamic glial cells has been revealed, indicating a putative role for inflammatory cytokines. Neurophysiologic and signal analytical studies in this and in another rodent model (GAERS) point towards a cortical site of origin, that SWDs do not have a sudden onset, and propose a more important role for the posterior thalamus than was previously assumed. Finally it is proposed that the reticular nucleus of the thalamus might be heterogeneous with respect to its role in propagation and maintenance of SWDs. The presence of a well-established cortical region in which SWDs are elicited allows for research towards new non-invasive treatment options, such as transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS) and transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS). The first results show the feasibility of this new approach.},

abstract = {[Objective] The study aims to investigate whether there is a higher excitability in the deep cortical layers of the peri-oral region of the somatosensory cortex as compared to other cortical regions in absence epileptic WAG/Rij rats and whether this is unique for this type of epileptic rats, as would be predicted by the cortical focus theory of absence epilepsy. [Methods] Excitability of cortical structures was assessed in a double pulse paradigm (inter-pulse interval 400 ms, 400 $\mu$s pulse duration, varying stimulation intensities (20-100 $\mu$A)). Electrical stimulation was applied to the subgranular layers of the somatosensory and motor cortex of freely moving WAG/Rij and control Wistar rats. Electrical evoked potentials (EEPs) and afterdischarges (ADs) were recorded during wakefulness, drowsiness and non-REM sleep. [Results] WAG/Rij rats, stimulated in the somatosensory cortex, showed higher amplitudes for the N1 and N3 components of the EEPs as compared to WAG/Rij rats stimulated in the motor cortex. This effect was present in all states of alertness and at all tested intensities. In addition, this effect was not (N1) or to much less extent (N3) present in nonepileptic control rats. Stimulation-induced 8 Hz ADs were predominantly found in WAG/Rij rats. ADs were longer after stimulation in the somatosensory than in the motor cortex and preferentially occurred during drowsiness. [Conclusion] There is a heightened excitability in the deep layer neurons of the perioral region of somatosensory cortex, which is unique for WAG/Rij rats. Moreover, the presence of 8 Hz ADs might point toward additional changes in the cortico-thalamo-cortical network. Drowsiness is an excellent state for 8 Hz ADs, mimicking spike and wave discharges (SWDs). The results are in good agreement with the cortical-focus theory of absence epilepsy. {\textcopyright} 2011 IBRO.},

abstract = {Absence epilepsy is characterised by recurrent periods of physical and mental inactivity coupled to bilateral, synchronous spike and wave discharges (SWDs) on the electroencephalogram. The mechanism of action of ethosuximide (ETX), a drug specific for absence seizures, is believed to involve a reduction in the low threshold T-type Ca(2+) current in thalamocortical and nucleus reticularis thalami (NRT) neurones, although other electrophysiological data have questioned this. Here, we employed a genetic rat model of absence seizures to investigate the effects of directly administering ETX to the thalamus.SWDs were immediately and substantially reduced (approximately 90{\%}) by systemic administration of ETX (177-709 micromol/kg), or by bilateral microinfusion into the thalamus of the GABA(B) antagonist, CGP 36742 (5-27 nmol per side). However, infusion of ETX (1-200 nmol per side) into the ventrobasal complex or the NRT resulted in a reduction of SWDs that was delayed (30-60 min) and less marked (approximately 50{\%}). Administration of ETX (0.2 mM to 1M) to a greater volume of thalamus by reverse microdialysis also produced significant but delayed reduction of SWDs at concentrations {\textgreater}1mM. Only at 5mM were seizures significantly reduced (approximately 70{\%}) within 30 min of administration. These results suggest that targeting of the thalamus alone may be insufficient for an immediate and full anti-absence action for ETX. Concomitant or exclusive actions in the cortex remain a possibility.},

The thalamic reticular nucleus (TRN) is hypothesized to regulate thalamo-cortical interactions, but the underlying functional architecture of this process and its state dependence are unknown. By combining the first TRN ensemble recording with psychophysics and connectivity-based optogenetic tagging, we found reticular circuits to be composed of distinct subnetworks. While activity of limbic-projecting TRN neurons positively correlates with arousal, sensory-projecting neurons participate in spindles and show elevated synchrony by slow waves during sleep. Sensory-projecting neurons are suppressed by attentional states, demonstrating that their gating of thalamo-cortical interactions is matched to behavioral state. Bidirectional manipulation of attentional performance was achieved through subnetwork-specific optogenetic stimulation. Together, our findings provide evidence for differential inhibition of thalamic nuclei across brain states, where the TRN separately controls external sensory and internal limbic processing facilitating normal cognitive function. $\backslash$n$\backslash$nPAPERFLICK},

Here we propose that mechanisms of memory and planning have evolved from mechanisms of navigation in the physical world and hypothesize that the neuronal algorithms underlying navigation in real and mental space are fundamentally the same. We review experimental data in support of this hypothesis and discuss how specific firing patterns and oscillatory dynamics in the entorhinal cortex and hippocampus can support both navigation and memory.},

We found that spindles with different durations were paralleled by distinct nRT activity, and nRT firing sharply dropped before the termination of all spindles. Both initial nRT and TC activity was correlated with spindle length, but nRT correlation was more robust. Analysis of spindles evoked by optogenetic activation of nRT showed that spindle probability, but not spindle length, was determined by the strength of the light stimulus. Our data indicate that during natural sleep a dynamically fluctuating thalamocortical network controls the duration of sleep spindles via the major inhibitory element of the circuits, the nRT.},

Using a new form of optical imaging in a brain slice preparation, we found that the corticothalamocortical pathway drove robust activity in higher-order somatosensory cortex. When the direct corticocortical pathway was interrupted, secondary somatosensory cortex showed robust activity in response to stimulation of the barrel field in primary somatosensory cortex (S1BF), which was eliminated after subsequently cutting the somatosensory thalamus, suggesting a highly efficacious corticothalamocortical circuit. Furthermore, after chemically inhibiting the thalamus, activation in secondary somatosensory cortex was eliminated, with a subsequent return after washout. Finally, stimulation of layer 5B in S1BF, and not layer 6, drove corticothalamocortical activation.
