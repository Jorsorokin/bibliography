abstract = {Sensory, motor and cognitive operations involve the coordinated action of large neuronal populations across multiple brain regions. Existing technologies reliably measure activity from a relatively small number of neurons with high spatial and temporal resolution, or from a large volume of neurons with low resolution. Timothy Harris and colleagues describe the design, fabrication and performance of Neuropixels, a silicon probe that can measure well-isolated neural activity from hundreds of neurons. They integrated these probes into a lightweight system that could record activity simultaneously and with high fidelity from hundreds of neurons in awake and freely moving rodents.},

abstract = {Most sensory, cognitive and motor functions depend on the interactions of many neurons. In recent years, there has been rapid development and increasing use of technologies for recording from large numbers of neurons, either sequentially or simultaneously. A key question is what scientific insight can be gained by studying a population of recorded neurons beyond studying each neuron individually. Here, we examine three important motivations for population studies: single-trial hypotheses requiring statistical power, hypotheses of population response structure and exploratory analyses of large data sets. Many recent studies have adopted dimensionality reduction to analyze these populations and to find features that are not apparent at the level of individual neurons. We describe the dimensionality reduction methods commonly applied to population activity and offer practical advice about selecting methods and interpreting their outputs. This review is intended for experimental and computational researchers who seek to understand the role dimensionality reduction has had and can have in systems neuroscience, and who seek to apply these methods to their own data.

abstract = {Background Unsupervised identification of action potentials in multi-channel extracellular recordings, in particular from high-density microelectrode arrays with thousands of sensors, is an unresolved problem. While independent component analysis (ICA) achieves rapid unsupervised sorting, it ignores the convolutive structure of extracellular data, thus limiting the unmixing to a subset of neurons. New method Here we present a spike sorting algorithm based on convolutive ICA (cICA) to retrieve a larger number of accurately sorted neurons than with instantaneous ICA while accounting for signal overlaps. Spike sorting was applied to datasets with varying signal-to-noise ratios (SNR: 3–12) and 27{\%} spike overlaps, sampled at either 11.5 or 23 kHz on 4365 electrodes. Results We demonstrate how the instantaneity assumption in ICA-based algorithms has to be relaxed in order to improve the spike sorting performance for high-density microelectrode array recordings. Reformulating the convolutive mixture as an instantaneous mixture by modeling several delayed samples jointly is necessary to increase signal-to-noise ratio. Our results emphasize that different cICA algorithms are not equivalent. Comparison with existing methods Spike sorting performance was assessed with ground-truth data generated from experimentally derived templates. The presented spike sorter was able to extract ≈90{\%} of the true spike trains with an error rate below 2{\%}. It was superior to two alternative (c)ICA methods (≈80{\%} accurately sorted neurons) and comparable to a supervised sorting. Conclusion Our new algorithm represents a fast solution to overcome the current bottleneck in spike sorting of large datasets generated by simultaneous recording with thousands of electrodes.},

We demonstrate an implantable silicon-based probe with a compact light delivery system, consisting of silicon nitride waveguides and grating couplers for out-of-plane light emission with high spatial resolution. 473 nm light is coupled into and guided in cm-long waveguide and emitted at the output grating coupler.

abstract = {Advances in silicon probe technology mean that in vivo electrophysiological recordings from hundreds of channels will soon become commonplace. To interpret these recordings we need fast, scalable and accurate methods for spike sorting, whose output requires minimal time for manual curation. Here we introduce Kilosort, a spike sorting framework that meets these criteria, and show that it allows rapid and accurate sorting of large-scale in vivo data. Kilosort models the recorded voltage as a sum of template waveforms triggered on the spike times, allowing overlapping spikes to be identified and resolved. Rapid processing is achieved thanks to a novel low-dimensional approximation for the spatiotemporal distribution of each template, and to batch-based optimization on GPUs. A novel post-clustering merging step based on the continuity of the templates substantially reduces the requirement for subsequent manual curation operations. We compare Kilosort to an established algorithm on data obtained from 384-channel electrodes, and show superior performance, at much reduced processing times. Data from 384-channel electrode arrays can be processed in approximately realtime. Kilosort is an important step towards fully automated spike sorting of multichannel electrode recordings, and is freely available github.com/cortex-lab/Kilosort.},

abstract = {Absence seizures are generalized, cortico-thalamo-cortical (CTC) high power electroencephalographic (EEG) or electrocorticographic (ECoG) events that initiate and terminate suddenly. ECoG recordings of absence seizures in animal models of genetic absence epilepsy show a sudden spike-wave-discharge (SWD) onset that rapidly emerges from normal ECoG activity. However, given that absence seizures occur most often during periods of drowsiness or quiet wakefulness, we wondered whether SWD onset correlates with pre-ictal changes in network activity. To address this, we analyzed ECoG recordings of both spontaneous and induced SWDs in rats with genetic absence epilepsy. We discovered that the duration and intensity of spontaneous SWDs positively correlate with pre-ictal 20-40. Hz ($\beta$) spectral power and negatively correlate with 4-7. Hz ({\O}) power. In addition, the output of thalamocortical neurons decreases within the same pre-ictal window of time. In separate experiments we found that the propensity for SWD induction was correlated with pre-ictal $\beta$ power. These results argue that CTC networks undergo a pre-seizure state transition, possibly due to a functional reorganization of cortical microcircuits, which leads to the generation of absence seizures.},

abstract = {—Objective: The process of grouping neuronal spikes in an extracellular recording according to their neuronal sources, is generally referred to as spike sorting. Currently, the use of spike sorting is mainly limited to an offline usage, where spikes are sorted after the data acquisition has been completed. In this paper, we propose a threshold-based spike sorting algorithm with a low and deterministic algorithmic delay, allowing for fast online spike sorting. Approach: At its core, threshold-based spike sorting is driven by linear filters. We propose a discriminative template matching filter design algorithm, which optimizes the output signal-to-peak-interference ratio in a data-driven fashion. The latter allows the filter to suppress the spikes of interfering neurons and to resolve spike overlap. Main results: The proposed discriminative template matching filters are validated on in-vivo ground truth data and are shown to provide a similar spike sorting performance as a state-of-the-art algorithm for offline spike sorting. Significance: The low algorithmic complexity allows for com-This work was carried out at the ESAT Laboratory of KU Leuven, in the frame of KU Leuven Special Research Fund projects C14/16/057 and CoE PFV/10/002 (OPTEC), and the Research Foundation Flanders (FWO) project FWO G0D7516N (Distributed signal processing algorithms for spike sorting in next-generation high-density neuroprobes).

Exploiting the dense sampling of single neurons by multiple electrodes, an efficient, low-dimensional representation of detected spikes consisting of estimated spatial spike locations and dominant spike shape features is exploited for fast and reliable clustering into single units. Millions of events can be sorted in minutes, and the method is parallelized and scales better than quadratically with the number of detected spikes. Performance is demonstrated using recordings with a 4,096-channel array and validated using anatomical imaging, optogenetic stimulation, and model-based quality control.

Early single-neuron recording research treated spike pattern variability as noise that needed to be averaged out to reveal the brain's representation of invariant input. Another view is that variability of spikes is centrally coordinated and that this brain-generated ensemble pattern in cortical structures is itself a potential source of cognition. Large-scale recordings from neuronal ensembles now offer the opportunity to test these competing theoretical frameworks. Currently, wire and micro-machined silicon electrode arrays can record from large numbers of neurons and monitor local neural circuits at work. Achieving the full potential of massively parallel neuronal recordings, however, will require further development of the neuron-electrode interface, automated and efficient spike-sorting algorithms for effective isolation and identification of single neurons, and new mathematical insights for the analysis of network properties.},

abstract = {Background: New, silicon-based multielectrodes comprising hundreds or more electrode contacts offer the possibility to record spike trains from thousands of neurons simultaneously. This potential cannot be realized unless accurate, reliable automated methods for spike sorting are developed, in turn requiring benchmarking data sets with known ground-truth spike times. New method: We here present a general simulation tool for computing benchmarking data for evaluation of spike-sorting algorithms entitled ViSAPy (Virtual Spiking Activity in Python). The tool is based on a well-established biophysical forward-modeling scheme and is implemented as a Python package built on top of the neuronal simulator NEURON and the Python tool LFPy. Results: ViSAPy allows for arbitrary combinations of multicompartmental neuron models and geometries of recording multielectrodes. Three example benchmarking data sets are generated, i.e., tetrode and polytrode data mimicking in vivo cortical recordings and microelectrode array (MEA) recordings of in vitro activity in salamander retinas. The synthesized example benchmarking data mimics salient features of typical experimental recordings, for example, spike waveforms depending on interspike interval. Comparison with existing methods: ViSAPy goes beyond existing methods as it includes biologically realistic model noise, synaptic activation by recurrent spiking networks, finite-sized electrode contacts, and allows for inhomogeneous electrical conductivities. ViSAPy is optimized to allow for generation of long time series of benchmarking data, spanning minutes of biological time, by parallel execution on multi-core computers. Conclusion: ViSAPy is an open-ended tool as it can be generalized to produce benchmarking data or arbitrary recording-electrode geometries and with various levels of complexity.},

abstract = {Spike sorting is a critical first step in extracting neural signals from large-scale electrophysiological data. This manuscript describes an efficient, reliable pipeline for spike sorting on dense multi-electrode arrays (MEAs), where neural signals appear across many electrodes and spike sorting currently represents a major computational bottleneck. We present several new techniques that make dense MEA spike sorting more robust and scalable. Our pipeline is based on an efficient multi-stage "triage-then-cluster-then-pursuit" approach that initially extracts only clean, high-quality waveforms from the electrophysiological time series by temporarily skipping noisy or "collided" events (representing two neurons firing synchronously). This is accomplished by developing a neural network detection method followed by efficient outlier triaging. The clean waveforms are then used to infer the set of neural spike waveform templates through nonparametric Bayesian clustering. Our clustering approach adapts a "coreset" approach for data reduction and uses efficient inference methods in a Dirichlet process mixture model framework to dramatically improve the scalability and reliability of the entire pipeline. The "triaged" waveforms are then finally recovered with matching-pursuit deconvolution techniques. The proposed methods improve on the state-of-the-art in terms of accuracy and stability on both real and biophysically-realistic simulated MEA data. Furthermore, the proposed pipeline is efficient, learning templates and clustering much faster than real-time for a 500-electrode dataset, using primarily a single CPU core.},

abstract = {Spike sorting involves clustering spikes recorded by a micro-electrode according to the source neurons. It is a complicated task, which requires much human labor, in part due to the non-stationary nature of the data. We propose to automate the clustering process in a Bayesian framework, with the source neurons modeled as a non-stationary mixture-of-Gaussians. At a first search stage, the data are divided into short time frames, and candidate descriptions of the data as mixtures-of-Gaussians are computed for each frame separately. At a second stage, transition probabilities between candidate mixtures are computed, and a globally optimal clustering solution is found as the maximum-a-posteriori solution of the resulting probabilistic model. The transition probabilities are computed using local stationarity assumptions, and are based on a Gaussian version of the Jensen-Shannon divergence. We employ synthetically generated spike data to illustrate the method and show that it outperforms other spike sorting methods in a non-stationary scenario. We then use real spike data and find high agreement of the method with expert human sorters in two modes of operation: a fully unsupervised and a semi-supervised mode. Thus, this method differs from other methods in two aspects: its ability to account for non-stationary data, and its close to human performance. {\textcopyright} 2006 Elsevier B.V.

While these methods can detect a large fraction of the spikes from a recording, they generally fail to identify synchronous or near-synchronous spikes: cases in which multiple spikes overlap. Here we investigate the geometry of failures in traditional sorting algorithms, and document the prevalence of such errors in multi-electrode recordings from primate retina. We then develop a method for multi-neuron spike sorting using a model that explicitly accounts for the superposition of spike waveforms. We model the recorded voltage traces as a linear combination of spike waveforms plus a stochastic background component of correlated Gaussian noise. Combining this measurement model with a Bernoulli prior over binary spike trains yields a posterior distribution for spikes given the recorded data. We introduce a greedy algorithm to maximize this posterior that we call "binary pursuit". The algorithm allows modest variability in spike waveforms and recovers spike times with higher precision than the voltage sampling rate. This method substantially corrects cross-correlation artifacts that arise with conventional methods, and substantially outperforms clustering methods on both real and simulated data. Finally, we develop diagnostic tools that can be used to assess errors in spike sorting in the absence of ground truth.},

@article{Harrison2007,
abstract = {Recent work in field of neuroprosthetics has demonstrated that by observing the simultaneous activity of many neurons in specific regions of the brain, it is possible to produce control signals that allow animals or humans to drive cursors or prosthetic limbs directly through thoughts. As neuroprosthetic devices transition from experimental to clinical use, there is a need for fully-implantable amplification and telemetry electronics in close proximity to the recording sites. To address these needs, we developed a prototype integrated circuit for wireless neural recording from a 100-channel microelectrode array. The design of both the system-level architecture and the individual circuits were driven by severe power constraints for small implantable devices; chronically heating tissue by only a few degrees Celsius leads to cell death. Due to the high data rate produced by 100 neural signals, the system must perform data reduction as well. We use a combination of a low-power ADC and an array of "spike detectors" to reduce the transmitted data rate while preserving critical information. The complete system receives power and commands (at 6.5 kb/s) wirelessly over a 2.64-MHz inductive link and transmits neural data back at a data rate of 330 kb/s using a fully-integrated 433-MHz FSK transmitter. The 4.7times5.9 mm2 chip was fabricated in a 0.5-mum 3M2P CMOS process and consumes 13.5 mW of power. While cross-chip interference limits performance in single-chip operation, a two-chip system was used to record neural signals from a Utah Electrode Array in cat cortex and transmit the digitized signals wirelessly to a receiver},

abstract = {Spike sorting is a crucial step to extract information from extracellular recordings. With new recording opportunities provided by the development of new electrodes that allow monitoring hundreds of neurons simultaneously, the scenario for the new generation of algorithms is both exciting and challenging. However, this will require a new approach to the problem and the development of a common reference framework to quickly assess the performance of new algorithms. In this work, we review the basic concepts of spike sorting, including the requirements for different applications, together with the problems faced by presently available algorithms. We conclude by proposing a roadmap stressing the crucial points to be addressed to support the neuroscientific research of the near future.},

@article{Bestel2012,
abstract = {To study the electrophysiological properties of neuronal networks, in vitro studies based on microelectrode arrays have become a viable tool for analysis. Although in constant progress, a challenging task still remains in this area: the development of an efficient spike sorting algorithm that allows an accurate signal analysis at the single-cell level. Most sorting algorithms currently available only extract a specific feature type, such as the principal components or Wavelet coefficients of the measured spike signals in order to separate different spike shapes generated by different neurons. However, due to the great variety in the obtained spike shapes, the derivation of an optimal feature set is still a very complex issue that current algorithms struggle with. To address this problem, we propose a novel algorithm that (i) extracts a variety of geometric, Wavelet and principal component-based features and (ii) automatically derives a feature subset, most suitable for sorting an individual set of spike signals. Thus, there is a new approach that evaluates the probability distribution of the obtained spike features and consequently determines the candidates most suitable for the actual spike sorting. These candidates can be formed into an individually adjusted set of spike features, allowing a separation of the various shapes present in the obtained neuronal signal by a subsequent expectation maximisation clustering algorithm. Test results with simulated data files and data obtained from chick embryonic neurons cultured on microelectrode arrays showed an excellent classification result, indicating the superior performance of the described algorithm approach. {\textcopyright} 2012 Elsevier B.V.},

abstract = {This study introduces a new method for detecting and sorting spikes from multiunit recordings. The method combines the wavelet transform, which localizes distinctive spike features, with superparamagnetic clustering, which allows automatic classification of the data without assumptions such as low variance or gaussian distributions. Moreover, an improved method for setting amplitude thresholds for spike detection is proposed. We describe several criteria for implementation that render the algorithm unsupervised and fast. The algorithm is compared to other conventional methods using several simulated data sets whose characteristics closely resemble those of in vivo recordings. For these data sets, we found that the proposed algorithm outperformed conventional methods.},

abstract = {Spike sorting is the process of assigning each detected neuronal spike in an extracellular recording to its putative source neuron. A linear filter design is proposed where the filter output allows for threshold-based spike sorting of high-density neural probe data. The proposed filter design is based on optimizing the signal-to-peak-interference ratio for each detectable neuron in a data-driven way. Threshold-based spike sorting using linear filters is particularly interesting for realtime spike sorting because of the low computational complexity and predictable delay of those filters, enabling closed-loop neuroscience with unit-activity controlled brain stimulation. We validate our method on both paired and hybrid in-vivo recorded high-density data.},
