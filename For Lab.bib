abstract = {Sleep spindles are major transient oscillations of the mammalian brain. Spindles are generated in the thalamus; however, what determines their duration is presently unclear. Here, we measured somatic activity of excitatory thalamocortical (TC) cells together with axonal activity of reciprocally coupled inhibitory reticular thalamic cells (nRTs) and quantified cycle-by-cycle alterations in their firing in vivo. We found that spindles with different durations were paralleled by distinct nRT activity, and nRT firing sharply dropped before the termination of all spindles. Both initial nRT and TC activity was correlated with spindle length, but nRT correlation was more robust. Analysis of spindles evoked by optogenetic activation of nRT showed that spindle probability, but not spindle length, was determined by the strength of the light stimulus. Our data indicate that during natural sleep a dynamically fluctuating thalamocortical network controls the duration of sleep spindles via the major inhibitory element of the circuits, the nRT.},

abstract = {Coordinated reset (CR) stimulation is a desynchronizing stimulation technique based on timely coordinated phase resets of sub-populations of a synchronized neuronal ensemble. It has initially been computationally developed for electrical deep brain stimulation (DBS), to enable an effective desynchronization and unlearning of pathological synchrony and connectivity (anti-kindling). Here we computationally show for ensembles of spiking and bursting model neurons interacting via excitatory and inhibitory adaptive synapses that a phase reset of neuronal populations as well as a desynchronization and an anti-kindling can robustly be achieved by direct electrical stimulation or indirect (synaptically-mediated) excitatory and inhibitory stimulation. Our findings are relevant for DBS as well as for sensory stimulation in neurological disorders characterized by pathological neuronal synchrony. Based on the obtained results, we may expect that the local effects in the vicinity of a depth electrode (realized by direct stimulation of the neurons' somata or stimulation of axon terminals) and the non-local CR effects (realized by stimulation of excitatory or inhibitory efferent fibers) of deep brain CR neuromodulation may be similar or even identical. Furthermore, our results indicate that an effective desynchronization and anti-kindling can even be achieved by non-invasive, sensory CR neuromodulation. We discuss the concept of sensory CR neuromodulation in the context of neurological disorders.},

@article{Huguenard1998a,
abstract = {The thalamus, known as the pacemaker for spindle rhythms in sleep, has several enabling features that promote such pacemaking. These include a circuitry that interconnects large groups of excitatory and inhibitory neurons, all of which are essentially capable of firing high-frequency 'bursts' of discharges. Bursts in thalamic reticular neurons produce powerful inhibition in thalamic relay neurons, which leads to rebound excitation. The timing properties of the inhibition regulate the network activity by controlling rebound burst latency. Anatomical features within thalamus such as convergence and divergence determine the spread and synchronization of pacemaking activity. The anatomical basis of divergence, i.e. the degree of axonal arborization of elements within the thalamic circuit, can be functionally modified in a dynamic fashion by biochemical pathways that regulate the properties of synaptic release. These data suggest that it will be possible to therapeutically regulate the thalamus to modify not only the propensity to sleep but also forms of epilepsy that rely on similar thalamic circuitry.},

abstract = {The coordinated reset of neural subpopulations is introduced as an effectively desynchronizing stimulation technique. For this, short sequences of high-frequency pulse trains are administered at different sites in a coordinated way. Desynchronization is easily maintained by performing a coordinated reset with demand-controlled timing or by periodically administering resetting high-frequency pulse trains of demand-controlled length. Unlike previously developed methods, this novel approach is robust against variations of model parameters and does not require time-consuming calibration. The novel technique is suggested to be used for demand-controlled deep brain stimulation in patients suffering from Parkinson's disease or essential tremor. It might even be applicable to diseases with intermittently emerging synchronized neural oscillations like epilepsy.},

@article{Pyragas2013a,
abstract = {Using Hodgkin-Huxley and isolated subthalamic nucleus (STN) model neurons as examples, we show that electrical high-frequency stimulation (HFS) suppresses sustained neuronal spiking. The mechanism of suppression is explained on the basis of averaged equations derived from the original neuron equations in the limit of high frequencies. We show that for frequencies considerably greater than the reciprocal of the neuron's characteristic time scale, the result of action of HFS is defined by the ratio between the amplitude and the frequency of the stimulating signal. The effect of suppression emerges due to a stabilization of the neuron's resting state or due to a stabilization of a low-amplitude subthreshold oscillation of its membrane potential. Intriguingly, although we neglect synaptic dynamics, neural circuity as well as contribution of glial cells, the results obtained with the isolated high-frequency stimulated STN model neuron resemble the clinically observed relations between stimulation amplitude and stimulation frequency required to suppress Parkinsonian tremor.},

abstract = {Neonatal treatment of Long-Evans Hooded rats with the cholesterol synthesis inhibitor (CSI) AY9944 has been shown to increase occurrence of spike-waves in EEG recordings and decrease benzodiazepines sensitivity of GABA(A) receptor-mediated responses in neurons from the thalamic reticular nuclei (nRt, Wu et al., 2004). The present experiments were designed to investigate the changes in the gamma2 and alpha1 subunits of the GABA(A) receptor in CSI model rats as possible mechanisms of these changes. Western blot, immunohistochemistry and real-time PCR techniques were performed to measure the levels of GABA(A) receptor gamma2 and alpha1 subunit transcripts and protein in the nRt and ventrobasal (VB) relay nuclei of thalamus and in somatosensory cortex. In CSI model animals, Western blot results showed that gamma2 subunit expression significantly decreased in thalamus (control, n=6: 0.17+/-0.02 relative to actin vs. CSI model, n=6: 0.11+/-0.01, P{\textless}0.05) but neither in cortex nor in hippocampal tissues. Conversely, alpha1 subunit expression decreased in CSI model somatosensory cortex, but not in nRt and VB. The present results demonstrate that neonatal block of cholesterol synthesis produces region- and subunit-specific decreases in GABA(A) receptor subunits in thalamus and cortex. Selective reductions in GABA(A) receptor subunits in thalamus may play a role in pathophysiology of absence epilepsy.},

@article{Coenen1992c,
abstract = {In this review, the main characteristics of genetic models of absence epilepsy, in particular with respect to WAG/Rij rats, are presented. Genetic models are important and relevant, since evidence exists that these models mimic spontaneously occurring human epilepsy more than models in which epilepsy is artificially induced. Genetic models can be divided into models in which seizures are elicited and into those in which epilepsy appears without any sensory stimulation. The majority of genetic models show the absence type of epilepsy; during the last few years, we and others have noticed that rats of various strains exhibit spontaneously occurring spike-wave discharges in the EEG. Among the strains highly affected is the WAG/Rij strain, which is a fully inbred strain. Individuals are homozygous and because of this property, genetic studies are meaningful. Electrophysiological studies have indicated that abnormal discharges in the cortical EEG are generalized and that the hippocampus is not involved. Parts of the thalamus, together with the thalamic reticular nucleus, apparently act as a pacemaker for the abnormal discharges. There is a circadian modulation in the number of spike-wave discharges. Discharges mainly occur during intermediate levels of vigilance such as passive wakefulness and light slow-wave sleep and at transitions of sleep states. Pharmacological studies with clinically effective antiepileptic drugs have shown a close agreement in seizure response between man and rat. Studies with new compounds have emphasized the role of the GABAergic and glutamatergic system in this type of epilepsy. Particularly striking is the role of the GABAergic system. GABA agonists enhance and GABA antagonists reduce the occurrence of spike-wave discharges, which deviates from the effects of GABAergic drugs in non-convulsive epilepsy. Even more striking is the role of the benzodiazepines, generally seen as GABA agonists; these drugs do not act as such in absence epilepsy since they reduce spike-wave discharges. Also good evidence for an involvement of other neurotransmitters such as noradrenaline, dopamine and opioid peptides exists in absence epilepsy. Genetic data obtained from the WAG/Rij model for absence epilepsy show a relatively simple pattern of inheritance with one gene determining whether an individual is epileptic or not, and with other genes regulating the number and duration of seizures. This is in good agreement with the more restricted human data. Cognitive studies have shown two important features of epilepsy in the WAG/Rij strain: modulation of the number of spike-wave discharges by mental or physical activity and on the other hand, the disruption of cognitive activity by spike-wave discharges. Finally, it is concluded from the aberrant shape of visual evoked potentials obtained during spike-wave activity that sensory processing during spike-wave discharges is different from that occurring during normal states of vigilance. These differences may correlate with changes in cognitive functioning during absences. ?? 1992.},

abstract = {In this computational study we investigate coordinated reset (CR) neuromodulation designed for an effective control of synchronization by multi-site stimulation of neuronal target populations. This method was suggested to effectively counteract pathological neuronal synchrony characteristic for several neurological disorders. We study how many stimulation sites are required for optimal CR-induced desynchronization. We found that a moderate increase of the number of stimulation sites may significantly prolong the post-stimulation desynchronized transient after the stimulation is completely switched off. This can, in turn, reduce the amount of the administered stimulation current for the intermittent ON-OFF CR stimulation protocol, where time intervals with stimulation ON are recurrently followed by time intervals with stimulation OFF. In addition, we found that the optimal number of stimulation sites essentially depends on how strongly the administered current decays within the neuronal tissue with increasing distance from the stimulation site. In particular, for a broad spatial stimulation profile, i.e., for a weak spatial decay rate of the stimulation current, CR stimulation can optimally be delivered via a small number of stimulation sites. Our findings may contribute to an optimization of therapeutic applications of CR neuromodulation.},

abstract = {1. To perform simulations of the various modes of action potential generation in thalamic relay neurons, we developed Hodgkin-and-Huxley style mathematical equations that describe the voltage dependence and kinetics of activation and inactivation of four different currents, including the transient, low-voltage-activated Ca2+ current (IT), the rapidly inactivating transient K+ current (IA), the slowly inactivating K+ current (IK2), and the hyperpolarization-activated, mixed cationic current (Ih). The modeled currents were derived either from acutely dissociated rat thalamic relay neurons (IT, IA, IK2), or from guinea pig thalamic relay cells maintained in slices in vitro (Ih). 2. The voltage dependence of steady-state activation and inactivation of IT, IA, and IK2 and the activation of Ih could be modeled with Boltzmann-style equations. Modeling of the behavior of IT to depolarizing steps in voltage clamp required the use of the constant field equation to relate permeability to T-current amplitude. The time constant of activation of IT was described by a continuous bell-shaped function with a maximum near 15 ms at threshold for activation (-75 mV) and 23 degrees C. Mathematical description of the kinetics of inactivation and removal of inactivation of this current required two separate functions. 3. The rapidly activating and inactivating K+ current IA was modeled by assuming two components with different time constants of inactivation. The kinetics of activation was described as a continuous function of voltage with the slowest time constant, near 2.5 ms, at threshold for activation (-60 mV) and 23 degrees C. In contrast, the kinetics of inactivation of both components were described as voltage independent, consistent with experimental data. The rate or removal of inactivation of both components of IA was described as continuously increasing with the degree of hyperpolarization. 4. The slowly inactivating K+ current IK2 was also modeled by assuming two components with different rates of inactivation. The kinetics of activation were described by a bell-shaped function with a maximum time constant near 80 ms at -40 mV and 23 degrees C, whereas threshold for activation was approximately -60 mV. Inactivation of both components was modeled as relatively independent of voltage, whereas removal of inactivation was described as a continuous function of membrane potential. 5. The hyperpolarization-activation cationic current, Ih, was modeled by assuming that the current activates with a single exponential relation and does not inactivate.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)},

abstract = {Several brain diseases are characterized by abnormal neuronal synchronization. Desynchronization of abnormal neural synchrony is theoretically compelling because of the complex dynamical mechanisms involved. We here present a novel type of coordinated reset (CR) stimulation. CR means to deliver phase resetting stimuli at different neuronal sub-populations sequentially, i.e., at times equidistantly distributed in a stimulation cycle. This uniform timing pattern seems to be intuitive and actually applies to the neural network models used for the study of CR so far. CR resets the population to an unstable cluster state from where it passes through a desynchronized transient, eventually resynchronizing if left unperturbed. In contrast, we show that the optimal stimulation times are non-uniform. Using the model of weakly pulse-coupled neurons with phase response curves, we provide an approach that enables to determine optimal stimulation timing patterns that substantially maximize the desynchronized transient time following the application of CR stimulation. This approach includes an optimization search for clusters in a low-dimensional pulse coupled map. As a consequence, model-specific non-uniformly spaced cluster states cause considerably longer desynchronization transients. Intriguingly, such a desynchronization boost with non-uniform CR stimulation can already be achieved by only slight modifications of the uniform CR timing pattern. Our results suggest that the non-uniformness of the stimulation times can be a medically valuable parameter in the calibration procedure for CR stimulation, where the latter has successfully been used in clinical and pre-clinical studies for the treatment of Parkinson's disease and tinnitus.},

abstract = {The thalamocortical network is modelled using the Wilson-Cowan equations for neuronal population activity. We show that this population model with biologically derived parameters possesses intrinsic nonlinear oscillatory dynamics, and that the frequency of oscillation lies within the spindle range. Spindle oscillations are an early sleep oscillation characterized by high-frequency bursts of action potentials followed by a period of quiescence, at a frequency of 7-14 Hz. Spindles are generally regarded as being generated by intrathalamic circuitry, as decorticated thalamic slices and the isolated thalamic reticular nucleus exhibit spindles. However, the role of cortical feedback has been shown to regulate and synchronize the oscillation. Previous modelling studies have mainly used conductance-based models and hence the mechanism relied upon the inclusion of ionic currents, particularly the T-type calcium current. Here we demonstrate that spindle-frequency oscillatory activity can also arise from the nonlinear dynamics of the thalamocortical circuit, and we use bifurcation analysis to examine the robustness of this oscillation in terms of the functional range of the parameters used in the model. The results suggest that the thalamocortical circuit has intrinsic nonlinear population dynamics which are capable of providing robust support for oscillatory activity within the frequency range of spindle oscillations.},

abstract = {Acoustic Coordinated Reset (CR) neuromodulation is a patterned stimulation with tones adjusted to the patient's dominant tinnitus frequency, which aims at desynchronizing pathological neuronal synchronization. In a recent proof-of-concept study, CR therapy, delivered 4-6 h/day more than 12 weeks, induced a significant clinical improvement along with a significant long-lasting decrease of pathological oscillatory power in the low frequency as well as $\gamma$ band and an increase of the $\alpha$ power in a network of tinnitus-related brain areas. As yet, it remains unclear whether CR shifts the brain activity toward physiological levels or whether it induces clinically beneficial, but nonetheless abnormal electroencephalographic (EEG) patterns, for example excessively decreased $\delta$ and/or $\gamma$. Here, we compared the patients' spontaneous EEG data at baseline as well as after 12 weeks of CR therapy with the spontaneous EEG of healthy controls by means of Brain Electrical Source Analysis source montage and standardized low-resolution brain electromagnetic tomography techniques. The relationship between changes in EEG power and clinical scores was investigated using a partial least squares approach. In this way, we show that acoustic CR neuromodulation leads to a normalization of the oscillatory power in the tinnitus-related network of brain areas, most prominently in temporal regions. A positive association was found between the changes in tinnitus severity and the normalization of $\delta$ and $\gamma$ power in the temporal, parietal, and cingulate cortical regions. Our findings demonstrate a widespread CR-induced normalization of EEG power, significantly associated with a reduction of tinnitus severity.},

@article{Yue2001a,
abstract = {Intrathalamic oscillations related to sleep and epilepsy depend on interactions between synaptic mechanisms and intrinsic membrane excitability. One intrinsic conductance implicated in the genesis of thalamic oscillations is the H current - a cationic current activated by membrane hyperpolarization. Activation of H current promotes rebound excitation of thalamic relay neurons and can thus enhance recurrent network activity.We examined the effects of H current modulation on bicuculline-enhanced network oscillations (2-4 Hz) in rat thalamic slices. The adrenergic agonist norepinephrine, a known regulator of H current, caused an alteration of the internal structure of the oscillations - they were enhanced and accelerated as the interval between bursts was shortened. The acceleration was blocked by the $\beta$-adrenergic antagonist propranolol. The $\beta$ agonist isoproterenol mimicked the effect of norepinephrine on oscillation frequency and truncated the responses suggesting that a $\beta$-adrenergic upregulation of H current modifies the internal structure (frequency) of thalamic oscillations. Consistent with this, we found that H channel blockade by Cs(+) or ZD7288 could decelerate the oscillations and produce more robust (longer lasting) responses. High concentrations of either Cs(+) or ZD7288 blocked the oscillations.These results indicate that a critical amount of H current is necessary for optimal intrathalamic oscillations in the delta frequency range. Up- or downregulation of H current can not only alter the oscillation frequency but also retard or promote the development of thalamic synchronous oscillations. This conclusion has important implications regarding the development of epilepsy in thalamocortical circuits.},

abstract = {Deep brain stimulation (DBS) is usually performed to treat advanced Parkinson's disease (PD) patients with electrodes permanently implanted in basal ganglia while the stimulator delivers electrical impulses continuously and independently of any feedback (open-loop stimulation). Conversely, in closed-loop stimulation, electrical stimulation is delivered as a function of neuronal activities recorded and analyzed online. There is an emerging development of closed-loop DBS in the treatment of PD and a growing discussion about proposing cortical stimulation rather than DBS for this purpose. Why does it make sense to "close the loop" to treat parkinsonian symptoms? Could closed-loop stimulation applied to the cortex become a valuable therapeutic strategy for PD? Can mathematical modeling contribute to the development of this technique? We review the various evidences in favor of the use of closed-loop cortical stimulation for the treatment of advanced PD, as an emerging technique which might offer substantial clinical benefits for PD patients.},

abstract = {Hodgkin and Huxley provided the first quantitative description of voltage-dependent currents and adjusted their model to experimental data using empirical functions of voltage. A physically plausible formalism was proposed later by assuming that transition rates depend exponentially on a free-energy barrier, by analogy with the theory of reaction rates. It was also assumed that the free energy depends linearly on voltage. This thermodynamic formalism can accurately describe many processes, but the resulting time constants can be arbitrarily fast, which may also lead to aberrant behavior. We considered here a physically plausible solution to this problem by including nonlinear effects of the electrical field on the free energy. We show that including effects such as mechanical constraints, inherent to the structure of the ion channel protein, leads to more accurate thermodynamic models. These models can account for voltage-dependent transitions that are rate-limited in a given voltage range, without invoking additional states. We illustrate their applicability to fit experimental data by considering the case of the T-type calcium current in thalamic neurons.},

abstract = {Inhibitory connections between neurons of the thalamic reticular (RE) nucleus are thought to help prevent spike-wave discharge (SWD), characteristic of generalized absence epilepsy, in thalamic and thalamocortical circuits. Indeed, oscillations in thalamic slices resemble SWD when intra-RE inhibition is blocked and are suppressed when intra-RE inhibition is enhanced. To elucidate the cellular mechanisms underlying these network changes, we recorded from RE cells during oscillations in thalamic slices and either blocked intra-RE inhibition with picrotoxin or enhanced it with clonazepam. We found that intra-RE inhibition limits the number and synchrony, but not the duration, of RE cell bursts. We then performed simulations that demonstrate how inhibition can shift network activity into a desynchronized mode simply by vetoing occasional RE cell bursts. In contrast, when intra-RE inhibition is blocked, RE cells burst synchronously, enabling even short RE cell bursts to promote epileptogenesis in two ways: first, by activating GABA(B) receptors, and second, through the GABA(B) receptor-independent emergence of network synchrony.},

abstract = {The gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA)-containing neurons of the thalamic reticular nucleus (nRt) are a major source of inhibitory innervation in dorsal thalamic nuclei. Individual nRt neurons were intracellularly recorded and labelled in an in vitro rat thalamic slice preparation to investigate their projection into ventrobasal thalamic nuclei (VB). Camera lucida reconstructions of 37 neurons indicated that nRt innervation ranges from a compact, focal projection to a widespread, diffuse projection encompassing large areas of VB. The main axons of 65{\%} of the cells gave rise to intra-nRt collaterals prior to leaving the nucleus and, once within VB, ramified into one of three branching patterns: cluster, intermediate, and diffuse. The cluster arborization encompassed a focal region averaging approximately 25,000 mu m2 and contained a high density of axonal swellings, indicative of a topographic projection. The intermediate structure extended across an area approximately fourfold greater and also contained numerous axonal swellings. The diffuse arborization of nRt neurons covered a large region of VB and contained a relatively low density of axonal swellings. Analysis of somatic size and shape revealed that diffuse arborizations arose from significantly smaller, fusiform-shaped somata. Cytochrome oxidase reactivity or parvalbumin immunoreactivity was used to delineate a discontinuous staining pattern representing thalamic barreloids. The size of a cluster arborization closely approximated that of an individual barreloid. The heterogeneous arborizations from nRt neurons may reflect a dynamic range of inhibitory influences of nRt on dorsal thalamic activity.},

abstract = {Networks of inhibitory neurons regulate synchrony during many physiological and pathological oscillations. To explore how these effects depend on cellular, network, and synaptic factors, we developed and validated a semisynthetic inhibitory network that approximates simultaneous activity in multiple neurons by using consecutive responses from single cells. We recorded from three types of neurons, each of which forms interconnected networks in vivo, but has unique intrinsic properties. In all three cell types, fast inhibitory coupling generated emergent gamma oscillations. By contrast, inhibitory coupling desynchronized slower, spindle-frequency responses specifically in thalamic reticular neurons. The emergent gamma-frequency synchronization was also specific to tonic input and did not occur during responses to phasic inputs. These results illustrate how particular features of inhibitory networks (e.g., cell or input type) contribute to their synchronizing or desynchronizing functions. They also demonstrate phenomena (emergent gamma oscillations) that occur robustly in multiple cell types and may thus be a generic feature of inhibitory networks throughout the brain.},

abstract = {Cerebrocortical injuries, such as stroke, are a major source of disability. Maladaptive consequences can result from post-injury local reorganization of cortical circuits. For example, epilepsy is a common sequela of cortical stroke, yet mechanisms responsible for seizures following cortical injuries remain unknown. In addition to local reorganization, long-range, extra- cortical connections might be critical for seizure maintenance. Here we report in rats the first evidence that the thalamus – a structure remote from but connected to the injured cortex – is required to maintain cortical seizures. Thalamocortical neurons connected to the injured epileptic cortex undergo changes in HCN channel expression and become hyperexcitable. Targeting these neurons with a closed-loop optogenetic strategy demonstrates that reducing their activity in real- time is sufficient to immediately interrupt electrographic and behavioral seizures. This approach is of therapeutic interest for intractable epilepsy, since it spares cortical function between seizures, in contrast to existing treatments such as surgical lesioning or drugs.
