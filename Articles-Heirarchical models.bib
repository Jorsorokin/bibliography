abstract = {A fundamental capacity of the perceptual systems and the brain in general is to deal with the novel and the unexpected. In vision, we can effortlessly recognize a familiar object under novel viewing conditions, or recognize a new object as a member of a familiar class, such as a house, a face, or a car. This ability to generalize and deal efficiently with novel stimuli has long been considered a challenging example of brain-like computation that proved extremely difficult to replicate in artificial systems. In this paper we present an approach to generalization and invariant recognition. We focus our discussion on the problem of invariance to position in the visual field, but also sketch how similar principles could apply to other domains.The approach is based on the use of a large repertoire of partial generalizations that are built upon past experience. In the case of shift invariance, visual patterns are described as the conjunction of multiple overlapping image fragments. The invariance to the more primitive fragments is built into the system by past experience. Shift invariance of complex shapes is obtained from the invariance of their constituent fragments. We study by simulations aspects of this shift invariance method and then consider its extensions to invariant perception and classification by brain-like structures.},

@article{Riesenhuber1999b,
abstract = {Visual processing in cortex is classically modeled as a hierarchy of increasingly sophisticated representations, naturally extending the model of simple to complex cells of Hubel and Wiesel. Surprisingly, little quantitative modeling has been done to explore the biological feasibility of this class of models to explain aspects of higher-level visual processing such as object recognition. We describe a new hierarchical model consistent with physiological data from inferotemporal cortex that accounts for this complex visual task and makes testable predictions. The model is based on a MAX-like operation applied to inputs to certain cortical neurons that may have a general role in cortical function.},

@article{Geman2006b,
abstract = {Pattern recognition systems that are invariant to shape, pose, lighting and texture are never sufficiently selective; they suffer a high rate of "false alarms". How are biological vision systems both invariant and selective? Specifically, how are proper arrangements of sub-patterns distinguished from the chance arrangements that defeat selectivity in artificial systems? The answer may lie in the nonlinear dynamics that characterize complex and other invariant cell types: these cells are temporarily more receptive to some inputs than to others (functional connectivity). One consequence is that pairs of such cells with overlapping receptive fields will possess a related property that might be termed functional common input. Functional common input would induce high correlation exactly when there is a match in the sub-patterns appearing in the overlapping receptive fields. These correlations, possibly expressed as a partial and highly local synchrony, would preserve the selectivity otherwise lost to invariance.},
