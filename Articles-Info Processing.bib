abstract = {Pattern recognition systems that are invariant to shape, pose, lighting and texture are never sufficiently selective; they suffer a high rate of "false alarms". How are biological vision systems both invariant and selective? Specifically, how are proper arrangements of sub-patterns distinguished from the chance arrangements that defeat selectivity in artificial systems? The answer may lie in the nonlinear dynamics that characterize complex and other invariant cell types: these cells are temporarily more receptive to some inputs than to others (functional connectivity). One consequence is that pairs of such cells with overlapping receptive fields will possess a related property that might be termed functional common input. Functional common input would induce high correlation exactly when there is a match in the sub-patterns appearing in the overlapping receptive fields. These correlations, possibly expressed as a partial and highly local synchrony, would preserve the selectivity otherwise lost to invariance.},

@article{Ullman1999,
abstract = {A fundamental capacity of the perceptual systems and the brain in general is to deal with the novel and the unexpected. In vision, we can effortlessly recognize a familiar object under novel viewing conditions, or recognize a new object as a member of a familiar class, such as a house, a face, or a car. This ability to generalize and deal efficiently with novel stimuli has long been considered a challenging example of brain-like computation that proved extremely difficult to replicate in artificial systems. In this paper we present an approach to generalization and invariant recognition. We focus our discussion on the problem of invariance to position in the visual field, but also sketch how similar principles could apply to other domains.The approach is based on the use of a large repertoire of partial generalizations that are built upon past experience. In the case of shift invariance, visual patterns are described as the conjunction of multiple overlapping image fragments. The invariance to the more primitive fragments is built into the system by past experience. Shift invariance of complex shapes is obtained from the invariance of their constituent fragments. We study by simulations aspects of this shift invariance method and then consider its extensions to invariant perception and classification by brain-like structures.},

@article{Brozovic2008,
abstract = {Gain modulation, in which the sensitivity of a neural response to one input is modified by a second input, is studied at single-neuron and network levels. At the single neuron level, gain modulation can arise if the two inputs are subject to a direct multiplicative interaction. Alternatively, these inputs can be summed in a linear manner by the neuron and gain modulation can arise, instead, from a nonlinear input-output relationship. We derive a mathematical constraint that can distinguish these two mechanisms even though they can look very similar, provided sufficient data of the appropriate type are available. Previously, it has been shown in coordinate transformation studies that artificial neurons with sigmoid transfer functions can acquire a nonlinear additive form of gain modulation through learning-driven adjustment of synaptic weights. We use the constraint derived for single-neuron studies to compare responses in this network with those of another network model based on a biologically inspired transfer function that can support approximately multiplicative interactions.},

@article{Goldman2001,
abstract = {The electrical characteristics of many neurons are remarkably robust in the face of changing internal and external conditions. At the same time, neurons can be highly sensitive to neuromodulators. We find correlates of this dual robustness and sensitivity in a global analysis of the structure of a conductance-based model neuron. We vary the maximal conductance parameters of the model neuron and, for each set of parameters tested, characterize the activity pattern generated by the cell as silent, tonically firing, or bursting. Within the parameter space of the five maximal conductances of the model, we find directions, representing concerted changes in multiple conductances, along which the basic pattern of neural activity does not change. In other directions, relatively small concurrent changes in a few conductances can induce transitions between these activity patterns. The global structure of the conductance-space maps implies that neuromodulators that alter a sensitive set of conductances will have powerful, and possibly state-dependent, effects. Other modulators that may have no direct impact on the activity of the neuron may nevertheless change the effects of such direct modulators via this state dependence. Some of the results and predictions arising from the model studies are replicated and verified in recordings of stomatogastric ganglion neurons using the dynamic clamp.},

@article{Babadi2013,
abstract = {Spike timing-dependent plasticity (STDP) modifies synaptic strengths based on timing information available locally at each synapse. Despite this, it induces global structures within a recurrently connected network. We study such structures both through simulations and by analyzing the effects of STDP on pair-wise interactions of neurons. We show how conventional STDP acts as a loop-eliminating mechanism and organizes neurons into in- and out-hubs. Loop-elimination increases when depression dominates and turns into loop-generation when potentiation dominates. STDP with a shifted temporal window such that coincident spikes cause depression enhances recurrent connections and functions as a strict buffering mechanism that maintains a roughly constant average firing rate. STDP with the opposite temporal shift functions as a loop eliminator at low rates and as a potent loop generator at higher rates. In general, studying pairwise interactions of neurons provides important insights about the structures that STDP can produce in large networks.},
